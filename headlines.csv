"I am planning on wearing a mask while on the Vancouver campus. Any suggestions on how to maintain/ handle a mask? 

I plan to change out the mask every three hours or so (or at least whenever I have sufficient time to do so). At first, I wanted wear a cloth mask and handwash the mask periodically (while still being on campus) but clearly this won't work because the mask definitely won't dry in time.

One solution is bringing multiple mask(s) and switching them out and then wash these masks once I return home. 

Other than wearing those disposable masks, I was wondering if there are alternatives to this. I am looking for either products or methods to safely handle/ maintain mask wearing.

Thank you very much!"

"b'You seem to have some misconceptions about how graduate school works, and how challenging academia is.  The surprising fact is not that so many of the students are international, but that so few of them are.\n\nAs public university we are required to admit a number of domestic students to our undergraduate programme.  Graduate admission is different and world-wide -- and of the 7.5 billion people on the planet only 37 million are Canadian.  In short you should be surprised that so many of our students are Canadian, rather than the reverse.  With the much wider pool of applicants, admission to UBC graduate school is far more competitive than admission to UBC undergrad -- only the best UBC undergrads are competitive for admission at UBC (the very very best handful are competitive at the top US schools; we are roughly at the tier below that).\n\nYou seem to assume that ""good domestic students"" will go to graduate school at UBC -- but this isn\'t the case.  A good domestic student could probably go to school somewhere in Canada (below us there\'s SFU, below that UVic, below that CapU and so on).  This doesn\'t mean our education sucks -- it means not everyone can go to graduate school, especially at a world-class school.\n\nFinally, I should add that yes, there are education systems in the world with higher standards than the Canadian one.  In mathematics, for example, what we call MATH 320 is a first-year course in much of the world (but recall that most of the world has a three-year B.Sc. so the comparable students at UBC are those who take our third-year courses in second year and so on).  However, personal ability counts more than knowledge (you can always catch up on knowledge!), and the Canadian system emphasizes research experience (USRA) which is also very important.'"

I am busy fighting NINE anti-male discrimination claims against UBC (that's a lot of paperwork), and I don't need more bureaucratic fighting or legal fighting, plus this guy seems troubled, and deserved a compassionate release in my opinion. I made a judgment call, and my judgment is this is a learning opportunity for him. I'm a philosophy major, and I've studied a full year of ethics, and in PHIL 230 (focus is moral theory/ethics) at UBC scored 93%, an A+ (class average was 76%). Only a few people managed this kind of grade in this ethics-focused course, to my memory. If anybody is connected with Dr. Anders Kraal, with whom I took PHIL 230, you're welcome to talk to/gossip with him (he definitely knows who I am) and ask whether he thinks I have some awareness of how to think through ethical issues (of course there is room for disagreement, but I think you'd hear that I am a fairly thoughtful guy, and may have some logic to what I choose to do). My judgment is not the final word, of course, but I feel I did the right thing. I'm proud of the ethical call I made. All things considered, this was the path to take. Also, UBC's administration has been informed, and I am hoping they finally put out a statement about the out of control protest of guests Duchesne/Hecht, which is related in theme. And I am not interested in debating my judgment call here. I have things to do. I am replying only to fill in some blanks for you. Note: I will likely not be logging back on to Reddit to deal with further comments, since this week has a number of appointments related to managing discrimination claims, and I feel I have already addressed your skepticism, which is inaccurate.

"b""Where's the every 3 hours option"""
"b""I think it's important to understand the purpose of a post-secondary education, and how it differs from secondary education.\n\nPost secondary education is competitive, and serves to produce the best students possible. As a program produces more notable students, it increases it's ratings, and draws more students there. Presumably, one of the main reasons you chose to attend UBC was because it is one of the best universities in the country. This isn't because UBC aims for mediocrity across all students, but aims to support the highest achieving students. Remember: university rankings aren't based off of GPAs, but based off of things like research outcomes.\n\nNow, it seems as though you have some mentality carrying over from secondary education. In publicly funded high schools, the goal is to make sure that as many students graduate as possible. The governmental goal is two-fold; to produce high achieving students, and to enable all students to have a basic education. The latter is why struggling students are offered accommodations. This goal doesn't carry over into post-secondary, though. There is no onus on the university to support lower-achieving students. After all, there are tens of thousands of students who didn't get admitted. If you're not performing well, then they might as well replace you with someone who will.\n\nI'm sorry that you feel that you're struggling. But remember: UBC goals aren't to meet each side of the coin - they're to meet the high-performing side of the coin."""

"b""I disagree entirely.\n\nYou're painting this as though it all comes down to online mentions, branding and trending topics - but there are real world consequences for UBC, for its students and staff if the university hosts these people. They don't simply go away if we all ignore them and allow them access to important platforms, like speaking at UBC. [Actual, active de-platforming](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/06/deplatforming-works-this-new-data-on-trump-tweets-shows/) has a greater effect than pretending they don't exist. \n\nI also think there's active harm done to the UBC community, especially people from marginalized groups, if you allow these kinds of speakers to use the university for publicity. What is UBC's commitment to the TRC findings, to righting historical wrongs, if it provides a spaces for genocide denial and racist rhetoric? Why should Indigenous students trust that this university has their best interests in mind? UBC has a long history of participating in the violent colonization of Canada - it can't just hope these ideas will go away while providing spaces and legitimacy for hate-mongerers. UBC has an obligation to its students, staff, and alumni - it's one they have to pursue *actively*, and I'm glad they did in this case.\n\nIf this person sells more books, or trends on Twitter because of this? Fine. I don't want my university associated with hate and bigotry, I don't want UBC to appease these viewpoints because its worried about Twitter trends. There are moral and ethical considerations that go beyond branding and publicity."""

The benefit is, lot\'s of people miss the deadline so if it\'s your first choice your chances are good.\n\nI really loved the town and the school, and Belgium is an amazing jumping off point for the rest of Europe.

"b'$10 on this being fake, the wording is just off'"
"b'The following are a few worries I had with the so called ""manifesto.""\n\nFirst, you cite Haidt\'s article about having to choose one telos: social justice or truth. This seems to be an exclusive disjunction. Can\'t one hold both values, and attempt to juggle both a dedication for truth and treating their students fairly? That seems to be the standard thought in University, and one that I personally hold. Why one or the other? I\'d also highly recommend you read the criticism of the Heterodox academy from the Yale philosopher Jason Stanley: https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Free-Speech-Fallacy/235520. \n\nSecond, regarding (1) it\'s not clear that social justice advocates hold data in contempt any more than anti-social justice advocates. In fact, even the most ardent social justice advocate cites data for their positions. Rape, for example, might be a cultural construct in the sense described by Ian Hacking: that it is contingent and not necessary. In addition, cross-culturally, rape does, in fact, happen in some cultures more frequently than others. So I\'m not sure what your issue with those who present rape as in some way cultural. \n\nRegarding (2), if indeed you agree with Christina Hoff Sommers on the earnings gap, she\'s wrong. Some social justice advocates and economists take the earnings gap seriously. Indeed, many social justice advocates cite economists regularly. For example, Claudia Goldman (a Harvard Economist) argues that choices make up only a small percentage of the disparity in the earnings gap observed in men and women. She argues that the gap in earnings has more to do with work being ""inflexible"" towards women. That is, many women take on the majority of the caregiving once they have children, and therefore often receive lower pay. They often receive lower pay, for the same work, because they need to juggle work and raising children. They, therefore, need jobs where they can work at home and have more flexible hours. Some would argue injustice towards women doesn\'t just include sexist or negative beliefs towards women, but can also include features about the way we construct our environments to favor men. Thus, as many feminist philosophers appear to argue, not having flexible work and having to do the lion\'s share of caregiving is a form of unfairness toward women that should be ameliorated. Goldin herself argues that work should be restructured to be more flexible in regards to work schedules, so even she seems to think this is an injustice of some sort. Heidi Hartmann (George Washington University) is also an economist that has looked at the earning\'s gap and takes it seriously. Stephen Rose (Georgetown University) is another economist that takes the earning\'s gap seriously. Similar things can be said about Solomon Polacheck (Binghamton University), an economist who argues that division of labour in the home is a result of gender discrimination, and that this division is responsible for a huge chunk of the disparity in earnings between women and men. Sommers is wrong on two fronts, then. She is wrong that economists don\'t take the earnings gap seriously, and she is wrong that ""choice"" explains most of the earnings gap. As an aside, Sommers isn\'t exactly a well respected intellectual for a few reasons. First, she operates out of a conservative think-tank, and any reasonable scholar can tell she\'s socially conservative regarding most inequalities toward women and other minorities. This bias permeates the way she reads data and how she draws conclusions from it. Second, she received a rather rough treatment by philosophers a while back for the lack of rigor in her work on feminism. That is, a lot of philosophers don\'t exactly hold her in high regard, due to her erroneous characterization of feminist thought. This could be why she abandoned academic philosophy, I\'d imagine. \n\nRegarding (3), I\'m not sure I follow why someone like myself needs to do as you recommend. Why am I obligated to engage with, for example, a climate change denier? Why can\'t I subject their views to disdain and ridicule? Why can\'t I choose not to engage at all, or even purposefully voice my opposition to them being included in the academy? \n\nRegarding (4) It\'s not clear to me that social justice advocates aren\'t internationalized in the way you describe, or that they have to be. Quite a few social justice advocates take their considerations to other countries. Chomsky, for example, has been an advocate for rights beyond the US. Additionally, some social activists might choose to focus on missing and murdered aboriginal women in Canada or the mistreatment of indigenous peoples in their own country. Are they wrong in doing so? Some choose to do work in their own communities, perhaps tutoring underprivileged youth. Are they wrong? It\'s my inclination that they aren\'t wrong.\n\nRegarding (5) It\'s not clear what ""men\'s issues"" refers to. On the surface, it seems like an implicit endorsement of including MRA views in the curriculum. That aside, ""men\'s issues"" appear to be already covered in some aspect of the curriculum already, so it\'s not clear that this is an issue at all that needs to be ameliorated. \n\nAs an aside, it\'s not clear to me that viewpoint diversity *is* inherently good or even *why* I should think it is inherently good. While having some variety of viewpoints might be valuable in some courses, it\'s not clear that every opposing viewpoint needs to entertained and taken seriously. For one, it\'s epistemically burdensome. Second, at some point, it\'s an intellectual waste. For example, environmental scientists shouldn\'t have to dispel every myth from climate change skeptics; in many cases, their intellectual energy is better spent actually finding solutions to climate change problems. It seems to me that the real value is engaging with the best ideas, not the most ideas. Third, I simply don\'t see the value in seriously considering really bad arguments and ideas. Most of the time I\'m extremely disappointed that I did so and regret it. The latter is based on the perfectly reasonable attitude that you don\'t have to engage with bad ideas, and it\'s often preferrable that you don\'t. '"

Make it more difficult for the opportunity to arise, or somehow make it harder for rapes to happen. For example, Safewalk wouldn\'t take a very drunk person. If someone is very drunk, a rapist might utilize this because the victim could be limited in options. Perhaps, if Safewalk did not turn people down for being extremely drunk, then this may prevent rapes from happening. The only argument is about how much it would mitigate the problem. No, I am not blaming the person for being drunk. I am just trying to give an insight on some probable case.\n2. Have an campaign that somehow targets the RAPISTS such that it will actually discourage them. Think about the Don\'t Mess with Texas campaign. It reduced the littering problem considerably by targeting the litterbug, rather than ads that litterbugs won\'t care about.\n3. Finally, there could be a better means of catching rapists. Some rapists are serial rapists, and to catch a (possible) serial rapist prevents future rapes.'"

"**\*Disclaimer. This is not an attack or invitation to send hateful comments/messages towards any of the women that appear in this video.**

The Plug UBC and founder Kalith Nanayakkara are coming under fire this week amid accusations of misogyny and stereotyping sorority women in their YouTube video ""Sorority Girls Share Their Juiciest Greek Life Secrets"", also previewed [in this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CP_ycRBH77I/?utm_medium=copy_link).

&#x200B;

Questions asked to the sorority women in the video focus on topics such as partying, alcohol, and hookup culture - stereotypes often associated with sororities. The reinforcement of such stereotypes and highlighting of toxic behaviour and culture can be harmful, and The Plug's lack of insightful questions to the women brings to light a potentially misogynistic culture.

&#x200B;

Another UBC student shared, ""this video makes me sick, especially knowing that these women could've provided such thoughtful and wonderful answers if the questions had been about empowering and relevant topics.""

&#x200B;

Students on Instagram are calling for Nanayakkara to take responsibility as his ""association with the UBC AMS is also a reflection of the AMS' values and attitudes... \[n\]o matter how distanced \[he\] is from the content"". Others share their discontent with ""Kalith, you are responsible for this messed up video... DO BETTER."" Nanayakkara was also investigated early this year for conflict of interest in his role as Vice President of External Affairs in association with The Plug UBC. He still holds his position today.

AMS President Cole Evans also shared his thoughts below the Instagram post, tagging Nanayakkara and commenting ""caption this shit I want to watch it while I'm in the gal"", referring to UBC's Gallery Patio and Lounge."

"b'The current political climate in the west is super volatile atm, particularly in the USA. It has gotten to the point where the dominant narratives are not talking to each other at all, but just bashing each other. But as someone else pointed out, this is primarily the media and reactionaries.\n\nI believe that we should be trying to reduce the amount of tension in all political discussions as much as possible to prevent this sort of ""with us or against us attitude"" that is increasingly popular in the mainstream media and in some circles. This will enable more cool heads prevail, as well as allow more of us to actually understand what our political opponents are advocating for; because from what I\'ve seen recently, ""politics"" has mostly been a combination of people talking past each other and/or tunnel-visioning to the point where they start refusing to slow down and ensure their or others\' position is understood. This also means that most of the political narratives we see are misrepresentations/straw-men of the popular opposition or are radical positions held in truth by a very small but loud minority.\n\nThe easiest solution to this kind of problem is probably to focus less on the media narratives and more on the people you know irl. Furthermore, we can try to ensure that whenever discussions to come around to politics, that we ensure ours and others\' positions are well understood before we try to take them apart, and to do so with determined good humor while preventing any sort of rise in emotional tensions.\n\nIf you are interested in my political leanings, I would have preferred Sanders in the USA and would now advocate for Biden primarily because I think Trump again would really threaten democracy in NA. I also think that our current political struggles are coming from a slow realization that our current systems have not been working for us, and that Trump\'s election in 2016 among other things was a resounding rejection of the status quo and every conventional authority. Unfortunately, because of the amount of built-up resentment due to just how lacking the current system has been in addressing issues, this rejection of the status quo has been very frenzied and hotheaded, resulting sometimes even in violence and open suppression by the governing powers in the USA. This is why I believe we must try everything we can to deescalate and reduce the polarization, as well as actually talk with each other about the issues, because otherwise we may start to lose our democracy. And perhaps if you wish to go the extra mile try to find solutions to the problems which have contributed to the increasingly polarized nature of politics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Focus more on the discussions with people irl rather than the skewed media narratives and try to keep things cool, rational, and compassionate.'"

"b'A lot of UBC is at least a little bit anti-Sauder, and the way I see it, there are several factors contributing to it. I would be lying if I said I didn\'t look down on Sauder a bit (and to be honest with myself it is pretty unfounded and dumb of me), but I\'ll try to explain how and why others feel the way they do.\n\nPretension - Many people feel there is a certain level of elitism in Sauder - I personally have not witnessed it much (most of the Sauder people I know are pretty cool), but I don\'t really know that many people in Sauder.  The perceived elitism is even more annoying considering elitism would is pretty unwarranted, as Sauder, while hard to get into, isn\'t a big deal any more than UBC as a whole is (a quick google of rankings puts Sauder in the top 3-5 Canada, but UBC seems to be generally a place or two higher). But this can be hypocritical, as many UBC students look down on SFU or colleges a bit, or inconsistent, as those who dislike Sauder for being pretentious don\'t necessarily dislike UBC for being pretentious.\n\nCondescension - I also know some people who are doing Sciences or Engineering with commerce minors, who all say that the courses they have to take for it are stupidly easy. So that sort of gives it a bit of a reputation of being for people who want to make money but are dumb. This is mean though, and there is no lack of dumb people in Sciences/Engineering. And that guy who isn\'t quite as smart as you but is way more driven is probably going to be more successful.\n\nSelf-perception - Ties into elitism. I have gotten the sense that some Sauder students think the dislike for their faculty has something to do with jealousy. This is probably just how Sauder markets itself to its students, but I can\'t see why it would be true - if you want to make the most of your Sauder experience, you absolutely need to have the drive to do plenty of things outside of school, and if you\'re in nearly any other field, that drive will ensure you are successful there as well. Maybe the supposed easiness of the courseload could be why, but that is more of a reason to be condescending. If anyone is jealous, it would be of that one guy who landed a job at GS, not the Sauder name itself.\n\nWhat they stand for - this probably doesn\'t apply to people on this subreddit as much seeing how fast Talon articles get downvoted, but things like the rape chant incident, lots of people in the greek system, and just the very nature of the curriculum (""capitalist brainwashing"" if you will), will draw negative attention from a pretty decent chunk of the UBC population.  Can\'t say much more about this other than that it\'s just a generalization like everything else.\n\nSomething interesting is that most the people I do know in Sauder would completely vouch for all of these stereotypes being true - I have heard some seriously awful stories about group projects, plagiarism is rampant, too many dumb people, no jobs, etc. But it\'s important to remember that it only takes 1/4 people to ruin a group project. I would not be surprised if the asshole ratio in Sauder is higher than most other faculties, but that doesn\'t mean most people in Sauder are assholes.\n\nNo tl;dr because it\'s mostly an expansion on what others have said'"

"b'Step back and take a larger view. The university is supposed to be a resource for you- you are not supposed to be a resource for them. That dichotomy can often put you in really negative positions where you then obsess about your personal worth. Welcome to life. \n\nThat said, if I were you, I\'d look outwards for more opportunities. As someone failed to say, arts majors have a far bigger challenge than most of the stem and business folks, because we\'re absolutely expected to invent ourselves repeatedly along the way and work much harder without a dedicated track in order to be successful. I look around at my peers and yeah, occasionally I feel pretty shitty about myself- but then I also remember that people in my field often don\'t find success until they get out of their twenties. The best thing to do is get a decent paying job you don\'t hate in the mean time. \n\nSo just get comfortable with that notion right now. Everything is going to be harder. You have to survive based on talent and personal innovation rather than relying on a corporate track that will guarantee you a job. And this is *one* program, not the rest of your life. \n\nPull up your britches, go out for a walk, make your way to the counselling office and the career centre and see what you can do to build on your progress so far.

"b'I\'m no lawyer but I don\'t think what they\'re doing is exactly ""stealing"".\n\nThe problem itself lies in the fact that they\'re generating money by re-distributing intellectual property that they do not have rights to. The way that they obtain those course materials I believe is through paying people currently taking those classes to give it to them (them being Prep101 or BYC). \n\n[Here is an interesting and relevant article](http://blog.jichikawa.net/2015/03/my-academic-materials-sold-without.html) posted by /u/jichikawa (Dr. Ichikawa is a professor in the Philosophy department) regarding CourseHero. Not exactly the same but the general idea is similar.'"
"b'>These people seem to neglect the fact that we live in a patriarchal society that is built for the benefit of men.\n\nA society where there are more women in university because our education system is tailored to them. A Society where men are expected to go to war to defend their women living at home. It is claimed that women make less money than men, but there are more homeless men than women. The balance is already tipped towards women and yet they still have the say they are oppressed and shut down men how try to help out their fellow men. '"

"b'Thanks for the feedback!\n\nIt wasn\'t meant to be a rant, and I admit my logic isn\'t perfect. I will adjust accordingly for future talks.\n\nOne point I will say. I did start that part by saying that I don\'t have time for people that offend simply to offend. If I didn\'t make that point strongly, I should have.\n\nI also thought I said that those examples were of people standing up and risking offending the status quo in order to make things better in general. Perhaps I didn\'t stress that in the right way. I will rethink my approach for that if I ever try it again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Update***: just to be clear so that everyone understands what I was going for in this part of the farewell outro...\n\nThe point of this part of the ""speech"" was that **NOT** having the right to **NOT** be offended has been an important facet of the hugely significant progressive victories that I listed as examples. Had the right to not be offended been a thing, many of these victories might have been much harder to achieve (and they were already hard won).\n\nNow, you can make the argument that, given the short duration of the speech, I was reductive about the complexities of many of these issues, and I agree that is something I perhaps need to address. The argument I was making overall though is that not having the right to not be offended is important. Or, to say it another way, being able to get past being offended in order to have significant and productive conversations about things is important.'"

b'This sub needs a FAQ'
"b'Going specifically through worklearn or any other university or government funded employment programme will require you to have the right to work in Canada, meaning PR/Citizen/Refugee. Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating for those who do not, such as those on study or temporary work permits, but you can imagine that the government and public would not want to spend public money on foreigners who may or may not intend to reside in Canada for longer than their permit.\n\nSome employers may also choose to make this restriction because they do not want to have to deal with an employee that could face having their permit revoked, or having to pay legal costs for their employee to get additional permits. As an employer making an investment in a prospective employee, you want to make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s no \xe2\x80\x9cwishy-washiness\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the desire or legal ability to remain in the country and work. \n\nIn the meantime, there are a lot of jobs available that aren\xe2\x80\x99t just digging ditches. Plenty of top firms hire foreigners on temporary permits. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t plan on staying in Canada for a long time, apply at an international firm that you could stay on with if you move back to the US or to a different country. If you do plan on staying, apply through different channels, like directly through the recruitment page or in person so there are no public funding issues involved. If they still require PR/Citizen, unfortunately that\xe2\x80\x99s just part of the process of moving to a different country. If I moved to the US I imagine my employment options would be even more severely restricted. \n\nBest of luck! \n\nEDIT: the post grad work permit is a good route, \xe2\x80\x9cprofessionals\xe2\x80\x9d or other highly educated people are favoured much more in the PR approval process.

"b'I\'m going to address these points the best I can, for people reading more so than the OP.\n\n1. The social justice is purposely not based on hard data for a number of reasons. First is that we recognize that data is not actually all that ""hard"" and is influenced by bias. Second, many of the arguing points of social justice are about legitimizing lived experience. There is simply no hard data that corresponds to this. The quotes presented about rape completely miss the point. ""rape culture"" is not saying that everyone who participates in it must be a rapist, it says that our social conditioning creates an environment where men feel entitled to women\'s bodies, and women are held responsible for unwanted advances. Social justice is not arguing that society is committing rape, that\'s ludicrous.\n \n2. As someone else said, it\'s the reasons why men and women make different choices that is the problem. Why are women more likely to leave careers after having children? Why do less women enter STEM? What role does our culture play in these choices? (hint: there is actually no data that backs up an assertion that women and men are biologically programmed for different fields. No one has ever been able to sufficiently control for culture)\n\n3. What you are asking for, at least when you\'re talking about marginalized individuals, is called tone policing. There are thousands of great articles about why it\'s not appropriate. I\'d encourage you to Google. As for non-marginalized ""allies"", there is actually alot of talking social justice circles about not co-opting the anger of the oppressed, and using privelege to have thoughtful and persuasive discussions.\n\n4. Social justice isn\'t trying to solve every problem in the world all at once. It started in North America, so it makes sense that\'s where it\'s focused. It\'s very focused on an intimate knowledge of the effects specific cultural norms and social structures on marginalized communities, it would be impossible for a North American activist to lead a movement in a culture that is unfamiliar, and actually would completely go against some of the main aims of social justice, including centering the marginalized and their experiences.\n\n5. Men\'s issues are a part of social justice. Almost every ""men\'s issue"" you can think of is a direct result of patriarchy and misogyny. Men\'s rights types just refuse to accept that because they rather enjoy patriarchy and misogyny.\n(apologize for autocorrect errors etc) '"

"I want to take the MCAT, but so far I only have 112 bio and 121 chem done in my degree. I'm going into my last year of my PSYC degree, and I want to know what the best plan of attack for MCAT prep and classes are. UBC has a spreadsheet of classes they recommend people take, but it would mean another 7 classes to hit all these recommendations. [https://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/files/2016/05/Previous-Science-Prereqs-2016-2017.pdf](https://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/files/2016/05/Previous-Science-Prereqs-2016-2017.pdf) 

&#x200B;

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Based on the spreadhseet classes, do I really need them all to succeeed in the MCAT? One example of this is the spreadsheet recommends 3 O-chem classes (CHEM 213, 233, 235) and 2 bio-chem classes (BIOC 202, 302). Would all of those be necissary?

&#x200B;

I spoke to a friend in a similar situation, but it's hard to tell since he is at a different school with different classes. It seems like too many Biochem and Ochem classes are recommended, but I want to make sure that I don't make the self-study aspect super difficult. My friend did mention that the classes just made the slef-study easier and the MCAT questions are ""a mile wide and an inch deep"".

"b'Okay this is going to be hard to hear OP, but this is a problem 100% due to how you\xe2\x80\x99re approaching dating. Girls will pick on even these *hints* of incel or \xe2\x80\x98nice guy\xe2\x80\x99 vibes and go running. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make a list of red flags in this post, and maybe you can use them to reflect on your approach and likely the corresponding attitude towards women. \n\n1. The knowing exactly when you kissed a girl comes off obsessive. Also, most first kisses suck, sorry yours made you feel so shitty about yourself though. And some people don\xe2\x80\x99t have any kind of romantic life at all while in school - in fact \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve ONLY kissed ONE person\xe2\x80\x9d can come off like you\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to raise your body count like women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies are just a status symbol to you. \n\n2. You put down a girl based off her appearance. Hard red flag. This implies you only had a \xe2\x80\x9ccrush\xe2\x80\x9d because the girl was pretty, and if that was the only reason you had a crush then you\xe2\x80\x99re superficial. Now you admit you\xe2\x80\x99ve never kissed anyone yet, but you felt the need to tell a sob story about how the girl who did agree \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t as pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n3. You\xe2\x80\x99re making wild assumptions about why women don\xe2\x80\x99t find you attractive. \xe2\x80\x9cUgly and short\xe2\x80\x9d especially are indicators that you\xe2\x80\x99re entirely superficial and therefore don\xe2\x80\x99t see personality as contributing to attraction. (Should also mention that when guys say things like this it gives off heavy incel vibes.) \n\n4. This one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem if the previous red flags weren\xe2\x80\x99t present but \xe2\x80\x9cactually had an intelligent intellectual conversation\xe2\x80\x9d implies a. maybe you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think pretty blonde women could be smart? b. the redundancy in highlighting how intellectual the conversation says again, maybe you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think women could hold conversations like that, thus you highlighting it twice. Again, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily think that if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t already seeing some red flags to how you approach dating. \n\n5. The self-flagellation and pity. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly hard to get out of these cycles where you just think the lowest of yourself, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a sign that you need to work on yourself instead of putting all your worth on getting a girlfriend. If you lack confidence in yourself then women won\xe2\x80\x99t want to be part of that cycle; we know we\xe2\x80\x99ll either have to end up as walking ego-boosts or you\xe2\x80\x99ll try and use guilt to get what you want. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be a good partner if you don\xe2\x80\x99t find any parts of yourself worth sharing. Ultimately, when you say things like \xe2\x80\x9cno girl finds me attractive, I\xe2\x80\x99m a loser with no friends who care\xe2\x80\x9d we think \xe2\x80\x9chow this person conducts themselves isn\xe2\x80\x99t making people comfortable enough to be close to them.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nYou need confidence, not in an entitled way, but in a \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m someone who will add on to your life instead of expecting you to 100% add onto mine.\xe2\x80\x9d Build meaningful relationships, don\xe2\x80\x99t look at women as just pretty things to hopefully have sex with, don\xe2\x80\x99t chalk up why you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been successful yet as \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ugly and short and therefore no one wants me\xe2\x80\x9d but reflect on your attitude and personality around romance.'"

"b""If you can't read, due to paywall\n\n>Marina Adshade teaches at the University of British Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s Vancouver School of Economics and SFU School of Public Policy.\n\n>Misogyny was on full display in London, Ont., last month during a 25,000-person street party in which several houses displayed bed-sheet signs promoting rape culture. The mayor, Ed Holder, condemned the signs, tweeting, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will not allow young women \xe2\x80\x93 be they students, faculty or otherwise \xe2\x80\x93 to be disrespected.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>But this culture that demeans and degrades women runs deeper than one street party. Last Halloween, one of the many Western University fraternity houses was accused of distributing flyers inviting underage women \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9c17+\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 to a party with the line \xe2\x80\x9cbooze will be provided, bring your own condoms.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>Closer to home, the same pattern of rampant misogyny knocked at my own door: A UBC student told me multiple women had been allegedly drugged in the university\xe2\x80\x99s fraternities recently. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shocked; I was saddened. As a female faculty member who is trusted and confided in by her students, and as a parent of UBC students, I have heard similar stories before.\n\n>The question I want to raise for all schools that permit fraternities: How long are we going to allow our campuses to be dominated by secret societies of men whose culture promotes unhealthy and dangerous behaviour toward women?\n\n>As an academic, my current research focuses on the lives of men and, specifically, on how the persistence of outdated ideas of what it means to be man is hurting both men and women. One of those outdated ideas, particularly in this age of #MeToo, is the belief that having sexual relationships with multiple women is a prerequisite to being a \xe2\x80\x9creal man.\xe2\x80\x9d This idea encourages men to aggressively compete for sexual access to women, not simply because they seek intimacy or sexual gratification, but because of the desire to their manhood to other men.\n\n>Within the fraternities, the culture of competition divides men into winners and losers; this not only persists, but is very much the point of participating in Greek life \xe2\x80\x93 it is the ability to prove yourself better than other men by belonging to a top tier fraternity.\n\n>That culture of competition is driving some (although not all) men in those institutions to take desperate, and extremely harmful, steps to prove themselves part of that group.\n\n>While belonging to a fraternity might give men a sense of superior status, studies have shown that those men perform worse in school, even after controlling for high-school performance. They are more prone to binge drinking and are more likely to be smoker. They watch more pornography than other male students and are more likely to hold negative and degrading views of women. Despite their reputation, they are not more likely to participate in sports than other men.\n\n>Most importantly, the evidence shows that men who belong to fraternities are more likely to be the perpetrators of sexual violence than are other men on university campuses \xe2\x80\x93 three times more likely, in fact.\n\n>Many have called this week for an end to fraternities on publicly funded university campuses. This is a laudable goal and I applaud anyone who promotes that as a societal ideal. The reality is much more complicated, however, and given that many fraternities physically exist off campus this idea is probably more aspirational than it is feasible.\n\n>What is achievable, however, is that universities bring an end to single-sex campus clubs. Men\xe2\x80\x99s clubs, and women\xe2\x80\x99s clubs in the form of sororities, only perpetuate the gender inequalities that are undermining our ability to progress as a society, and our ability to grow as an economy. Women make up the majority of students in universities across the country; it seems very reasonable to ask that universities take this relatively minor action to promote their best interests while on campus, and to level the playing field for those women in the work force.\n\n>Finally, governments need to amend outdated Human Rights Codes that permit landlords of multi-unit housing to discriminate against potential tenants based on characteristics such as sex, gender, sexual orientation and race when tenants share bathrooms or kitchens.\n\n>Fraternities are simply boarding houses, and they should not be allowed to restrict their tenancy to men, especially in an era in which most campus housing is mixed gender and when housing is expensive and in extremely short supply.\n\n>We all grew up in houses in which kitchens and bathrooms were shared with men and women, there is no good reason why students cannot live this way, and there is good reason to believe that living this way will encourage a better treatment of women."""

Think about the line-ups for the women's toilets or any of the food service places between classes.  Think of how crowded busses like the 99 are at peak times. \n\nOne prof may teach hundreds of students in a week -- there are even individual classes of 500 students in some faculties at UBC.  Many students take 5 courses a term and some are in class 5 days a week.  The mind boggles at the number of contacts that could represent.\n\nProfs don't have their own dedicated classrooms like teachers do in primary and some secondary schools and there's no way such a setup could be created.  Most faculty don't even have their own private offices: they share with at least one other person.  TAs and grad students often don't have offices either, and if they do they're always shared with several other people.  \n\nThere's no way learning groups of any size like the ones mentioned in the article could be created.

It\'s a place i MUST visit - dem korean makeup brand and dem kpop tho).\n\nNot really... its isolated in that well its like \n\n    UBC  (A FOREST)  Rest of Vancouver\n\nIts not that hard to leave though, in fact most students commute to/from school. It would take ~30 minutes to get to Downtown, ~45 minutes to Richmond(basically where all the non-mainland chinese people live), and ~1hour to get to Crystal from UBC. That being said, you\'re most likely not going to be able to go out somewhere during the weekdays especially in Engineering (not because theres a lot of work, but because your classes end late. I think I ended ~5pm on average in first year). Or you could skip classes and go anyways like I did, but I would highly recommend not doing that from experience. Weekends/after exams are a completely different story.\n\n>And I understand that Engineering is going to be torturous and I probably won\'t have time for the things I want to do. But its worth noting, just in case my time frees up~\n\nIts actually not that bad as long as you use your time wisely, don\'t skip like 110% of your classes, do the homework, and try to keep up with your classes. I\'m honestly not sure where the rumors that first year engineering is super hard come from, because honestly its not all that hard, the hardest thing is learning to become more self-motivated and disciplined, which applies to any first year program. The thing is that now, if you skip a class, skip a homework, skip a midterm even, UBC isn\'t gonna call home and tell your parents you skipped or something, there isn\'t really an immediate consequence of going home and getting in ""trouble"" because you skipped. Its more that you get screwed later because you end up falling behind so you don\'t understand things you should etc. and you end up doing poorly on exams, maybe failing courses, and not getting into the discipline you want.\n\n>dem kpop tho\n\nMost importantly: Favourite group?'"

"b'Hi! Former student who has completed 5 engineering co-op work terms here. I just want to share why I think co-op is very valuable from an **engineering perspective**. \n\n1. Most students do not realize that the co-op office has a lot of resources available to not just help with the co-op job search but also the after graduation job search. 1 on 1 appointments with coordinators are super valuable for revising resumes, conducting mock interviews, and discussing strategies for job searching.\n2. The average range of pay is $18-22, with some positions even getting into the 30s. The positions available are dependent on the season. However, with COVID still going on, there are still hundreds of great postings - a student just needs to search diligently for them.\n3. The $800 domestic fees for a 4 month co-op work term may be seen as expensive, but most students do not know that **you are registered as a full time student during co-op**. You pay for the continued access to UBC facilities and a UPass. It also permits the continuation of any loans because of the full time status.\n4. Unfortunately, COVID is limiting the international opportunities. However, the job board constantly gets updated with new postings and there are still many available.\n\nCo-op gives you experience and some time away from school. It is an opportunity to try working in a professional setting in your field and is a competitive advantage. Hopefully some of this helps some students out there! Cheers :)'"

I just want to put it out there that even though it's slightly difficult, please respect the fact that we are still not out of the pandemic just yet.

What needs to be fixed:

\- Many profs make students collect exams in lecture halls, with everyone crowding and just breathing into each other's faces. --> Maybe it's better to have exam collection times or having single file lines.

\- When waiting at food line ups or line ups at the bus loop, people DO NOT social distance. I know restrictions are being lifted, but until the mask mandate is not lifted, the rules must be followed.

\- Those who have a cold, please cover yourself when coughing or sneezing. Please also stay home if you are absolutely sick. Many profs are accomodating and it's just a matter of asking them.

\- On the bus and skytrain --> Don't shove yourself into people. I know during rush hour there is literally no space, but when there is space, try to sit one seat away from those around you. Also, if possible wait for the next bus/train.

\- Everyone's doing really well with masks! Great job!

"b""Despite all the downvotes, you are not wrong. The #99 seems to have some issues with reliability over the summer weekends, with buses often bunching and the wait-times sometimes going up to 20-30 minutes. I also seem to get a dozen of Transit Alert e-mails every Sat/Sun on cancellations or short-turning #99 buses and see quite a few #99s deadheading (running NIS) between Comm'l-Bdy and UBC just to catch up with the schedule.\n\n[A Nextbus screenshot at 7 p.m. on a Sunday](https://imgur.com/KdLxVVy)\n\nThere seems to be a few reasons causing this:\n\n1. **All kinds of detours & reroutes**. The University Blvd detour for sure have an impact on reliability, and this is often what TransLink cites as the reason for the delays. But there's very little traffic west of Blanca and it shouldn't be throwing buses 30 minutes off schedule. Occasionally there are detours in Mt. Pleasant, Kits or Point Grey due to a variety of events, and sometimes this does add delays to the #99. However, I am not aware of any special event detours this weekend, yet many buses are still very off-schedule.\n\n[A tweet from a #99 rider's friend from this weekend, and TransLink admitting the delays](https://twitter.com/dkdrums/status/1023692863622660096)\n\n2. **Insufficient run time**. The #99 is scheduled 40-42 minutes to travel between Commercial-Broadway and UBC on Saturday & Sunday middays, similar to the time given on a weekday and during peak hours when the bus lane is in effect. Comparing schedule from last summer, it seems like this year's runtime is similar or 1-2 minutes shorter than last year's runtime. Traffic isn't ,uch better on Broadway on Saturdays/Sundays than on weekdays and it's pretty challenging to travel across the city within 40 minutes on a Saturday afternoon w/o any dedicated right of way. In fact, Google Maps suggested that a driving trip along the 99 route would take anywhere from 28 minutes to an hour. So insufficient run time given by TransLink definitely contributes to the delay.\n\n3. **The lack of transit priority**. As the busiest diesel bus route in Canada and United States, it is absolutely inconceivable that the route has such restricted access to a dedicated transit lane and absolutely no signal priority. Weekend traffic on Broadway is no better than weekday traffic, particularly over the summer where people head out more often. Even though the idea of a full-time bus lane on Broadway has been afloat for many years, it will most likely never happen until and after the subway comes. The City of Vancouver often talks about how popular the #99 bus route is, how important transit is for the city's economy and how much the city aims to become the greenest city of the world, but it often drops the ball on things that would make transit faster and more reliable. (I can talk about this for 20 minutes straight but wouldn't bother anyone here.)\n\nTransLink can only run as many buses because of its limited resources, and success of buses heavily rely on roads, many of which are managed by municipalities. Every city plays an important role on helping to improve their transit system, and one can't walk away from the problem just because a subway will come in 7 years and everyone riding transit can just get stuck in traffic in the meantime. Mayor's Council's chair Derek Corrigan pointed [this](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/derek-corrigan-translink-b-line-1.4600543) out a few months ago:\n\n>\\[Corrigan\\] says certain mayors and councils have been reluctant to provide off-street parking to free up lanes for transit use and coordinate lights at intersections to make traffic flow better.  \n>  \n>(Note: I honestly can't believe I'm quoting Corrigan on a transit issue.)\n\nIt can be politically challenging to add bus lanes and co-ordinate traffic lights, but it's similar to what the city has been doing when it improves bike infrastructures, putting in Mobi Stations and add patios on the street. I've heard that the city has passed some policy on transit reliability in the past, but I have seen not much action in reality.\n\nIn any case, the delays you're experiencing are pretty complicated issues, and part of it is pretty political. I'm planning to write to TransLink (despite having writing in many times) and to the city about it, but I don't know how likely it is for the core issue to be addressed before the Broadway extension opens in 7-8 years time. And after the subway is opened, what is going to happen to other problematic routes? - 41st ? Commercial ? Hastings ?"""

BLM marches weren\'t triggered in 2020 because someone told a joke or got offended, they happened because the police repeatedly murdered black folks in high profile cases over marginal offences, and revealed systematic bias that was resulting in black people getting murdered for no reason.\n\nOf course free speech guys often aren\'t smart enough to figure out that you actually need to know what you\'re talking about to be respected for saying it.

Let me also start by saying that I'm sorry that you can't get into the courses that you want. I know that stinks.\n\nNext, the part you won't like: as you may know, we have made a great deal of effort to make sure that students in our majors can get the classes that they need to graduate. This means that we need to make restrictions that prioritize our majors. Unfortunately, this means that there are other people who would benefit from taking the courses who cannot get in. I would like nothing better than to let everyone who wants to take a course get in, but it's not possible.\n\nAs to the prerequisites, it is very hard to teach a course where students have different backgrounds coming in, so many of our classes need to have prereqs so that we know the students will have homogeneous backgrounds.\n\nThat being said, the intention was that CPSC 330 should have a prereq structure such that, assuming there were enough seats, CPEN students should have the prereqs for it. Looking at the calendar, at some point, someone messed up. I've asked the people who know what to do to get this fixed."""

"b""Ultimately UBC took around a week longer to shut down than most other universities. In the end it didn't seem to be a huge issue. If UBC students were affected by COVID en masse and/or students died, then the culpability would be more serious.\n\nIn general though it's not just UBC per se. The issue is that Western countries in general overestimate their safety. Most Westerners haven't actually suffered that much (no mass famines, pandemics, wars in recent years) so there's a systemic tendency to think everything's going to be okay.

"b""Hey! Welcome to UBC:) I went to Homecoming in my first year (Fall 2019) and had a pretty fun time. I went with friends I had made in JumpStart and we put on blue & yellow facepaint in front of the residence halls and basically walked in this huge crowd to the Thunderbird Stadium to watch the UBC football team and cheer them on. It was pretty much the typical football game vibes that you see in the movies with our mascot hyping us up and a lot of cheering. From what I've seen about Homecoming this year, most of it looks virtual which means it won't have the football game vibes with a huge crowd of UBC students (makes sense cuz covid) so I personally don't think it would be worth paying money for.   My recommendation is when Homecoming goes back to fully in person so probably next year, definitely check it out because it's a nice UBC experience to be a part of. There are also other cool one-day sporting events at UBC like the Winter Classic Hockey Game which usually happens in January so if you're interested in that, there's a chance it'll be in person for this coming school year.

There are only so many ways to test a SELECT, a JOIN, a division...etc, and I found that encouraging students to just practice so that after a while, you not only begin to see patterns in how you are able to work with tables, but you\'ll instinctively begin to know which queries might work for a given problem.\n\nNow, ""just practice"" seems like generic advice, and I\'m not saying you need to put in a 110-level amount of dedication, but just getting (and remaining) comfortable with working with the questions is probably the most important part.

"b'As a Black Canadian/1st gen Canadian, I am extremely tired of the notion that our struggles are incomparable to Black Americans. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why people continue to bring this up in spite of Black people in this country continuously stating how harmful these ideas are, but let\xe2\x80\x99s unpack this post, in good faith of course.  \n\nPercentages have absolutely nothing to do with experiencing racism. I know you scratched this out, but I also fail to understand why the comparison to Chinese Canadians was made. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to realize the utter ignorance of your statement. \n\nNot all Black Canadians are immigrants. There are many Black Canadians part of families that have been here for hundreds of years due to the transatlantic slave trade. Please, do your research. \nStating that the racism experienced by Black Canadians is incomparable to Black Americans completely invalidates our experiences. How would YOU know, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not Black? Canadians love to separate themselves from the USA when in actuality, the countries are incredibly similar, as someone who was born and raised in the east coast of Canada. The only difference is that through ignorance and denial, Canadians are a lot better at hiding these issues and presenting the country as filled with \xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d people. Not too long ago, a Black man in Calgary was killed by police. A woman in London, Ontario was punched by London police. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a country with more lax gun laws to have existing and rampant police brutality. Health care system. Black Canadians are denied treatment, as we\xe2\x80\x99re seen as \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d and incapable of feeling pain, very similar to the USA. Racism experienced in health care has even turned away some from getting the help they need. A good example of this would be when it comes to mental health and mental illness. But even beyond these issues, racially targeted aggressions in schools, excessive policing in schools, streamlining Black students, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 all occur for Black Canadians. YOU wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know this, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not Black. \n\nThese issues are also just as prominent in the West Coast, regardless of what percentage of Black people there are. I just finished my first-year at UBC, and in the 8 months I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here, my fellow Black peers and myself have been called a \xe2\x80\x9cgang\xe2\x80\x9d, been made to feel less competent in courses by peers, picked on for our hair styles whether it be in an afro, braids, locs, been told our taste is ghetto, and have felt the pressure of having to be everything that is perfection being the few there are in our faculties. This is just the tip of the iceberg of racial aggressions I\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced in Vancouver. The West Coast is most certainly not a safe haven for us. Nor is anywhere in this country, really. And this sentiment is universal between Black Canadians, Brits, Americans, all over the world! \n\nFinally, I will address the topic of the BIPOC and POC terms. I do believe that there can exist some reductionism within the terms, as in everyone who is not white is grouped as other. I also feel as though if you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to a specific race, say the race, not POC or WOC. If you mean Asian, say Asian. But again, your statement does include ignorance. BIPOC as a term was created to highlight the notable differences Black and Indigenous people experience. Because yes, it is different to other people of colour. This is, of course, not to say that one is less valid than another, no. It is to recognize the systems in place and how they affect individuals. As we know, Canada has committed genocide toward the Indigenous community. I will not get into all of the details as it is not my place as someone who is not Indigenous, but it is clear to see that there is a difference. As for Black people, the entire system and logic which is racism is birthed from the fundamental belief that the darker you are, the lesser you are. Black has always been the bottom of the barrel, in every society, in every culture. The closer you are to whiteness in any degree, the more privilege you get in society. Anti-blackness exists in ALL systems on this planet and is intricately woven with the idea of white supremacy. This makes the experiences of Black people fundamentally different. AGAIN, the experiences of all racialized communities are valid and SHOULD be discussed. I am an advocate that we need to discuss the rampant anti-Asian hate that has been ongoing and skyrocketing throughout the pandemic. But it is incredibly unfair and ignorant to make these claims about the experiences of Black Canadians, compare them to other races, when you are not Black. Why not accept that there are certain experiences you do not have the knowledge on and work on doing the research to learn. You would think that people would at least have a semblance of empathy toward others.\n\nThis was an incredibly long post, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen too many times on r/UBC people spewing all types of things about Black people and I will not stand for it. Open books, Google search, anything. But STOP invalidating our experiences.'"

I guess ways to increase your chances of getting an A on the assignment is: handing them in on time, don\xe2\x80\x99t just do the work for the sake of completion, but do it with yo ur best effort. Attend office hours if you\xe2\x80\x99re having difficulties, and when you receive back your previous assignments, use the feedback that the TA gives you to improve or do better on the next. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say that one will receive an A on assignments because it can really depend on how the TA marks and that can be holistic, depending on what the assignment is. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tear yourself down either if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the mark you desire.

"b"">I'm not allowed to be cool and popular like all the other people are.  \n\n\nWhat's stopping you?\n\n\n>And words can\xe2\x80\x99t even encapsulate how poorly women think of me. I remember in 7th grade, we had this school dance and I asked a girl to dance. \xe2\x80\x9cEww, not with you, loser, get away from me\xe2\x80\x9d. And then all of her friends, and even the guys, laughed at me. I went to the washroom to cry. \n\n\nI'm sorry that this happened to you. That being said, children are immature and cruel, and people usually get a lot better at this kind of thing as they age.\n\n\n>Needless to say, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten much better nearly a decade later.\n\n\nWhen was the last time you tried talking to someone in a casual context?\n\n\n>Why is all of this happening to me? Because I'm a loser. I'm an ugly, weak, virgin beta-male. I'm a loner. Cursed for life.\n\n\nHaving issues with social interaction =/= being a loser or being cursed for life.  \n\n\n>Jobs, grades, careers, all of that is irrelevant. All that matters is how cool you are. Your status with respect to other people.\n\n\nI have never considered how 'cool' someone is as a factor for spending time with them, and most of the people I interact with don't care about that either. Why do you  feel that being 'cool' is so important to you? What does it mean to be 'cool'? \n\n\n>And if you're a loser, or even if you look like a loser, deep down everyone will feel contempt for you regardless of your job or your salary (even if they act polite). \n\n\nHonestly, I doubt that you'd make a strong enough impression on people that a majority of people you meet immediately feel contempt for you. On a side note, what does it mean to look like a loser? If you are dissatisfied with the way you look, there are ways to change things. \n\n\n>And I'm destined to forever be a loser. \n\n\nYou use the word loser a lot, but I'm not clear on what you mean by that. If loser = no friends, you come across as reasonably articulate in this post, if bitter at your circumstances, and I see no reason you couldn't find an in-group provided you work at it.  \n\n\n>I couldn't be cool in high school and I can't be cool in uni. \n\n\nWhy the preoccupation with being cool? What does that mean to you?\n\n\n>All of this is pointless\n\n\nI mean, your life is what you make of it. Just because it's pointless to you now doesn't mean that things can't change. \n\n\n>I'm turning 20 later this year. My teens are gone, and my youth is gone.\n\n\nI'm turning 21 this year and I still consider this my youth. \n\n\n>Slave away at a 9-5 dev job, go home alone, play video games and go to sleep. Pathetic. Why live such a life\n\n\nWhy not? If you're reasonably satisfied with being a dev and get enjoyment out of playing video games it's a perfectly valid lifestyle choice. If you hate being a dev you might want to consider some lifestyle changes, but that doesn't mean having a 9-5 job and playing video games is a bad thing, it just might not be for you. \n\n\n>If you're a low-status, low-testosterone guy\n\n\nIf your testosterone levels are actually low you might want to get that checked out\n\n\n>without any particularly remarkable skills, your life is basically pointless.\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I am a very unremarkable person but I'm alright with where my life is right now. \n\n\n>Men are supposed to be strong and tough, so people will think of me as a pathetic coward for complaining.\n\n\nYou're not a coward for reaching out. \n\n\n> I\xe2\x80\x99m a natural beta-male. It\xe2\x80\x99s genetic, most likely\n\n\nThere is no such thing as being genetically 'beta' or 'alpha'. You might have trouble with talking to people because of you're out of practice at human interaction, or social anxiety, lack of confidence, whatever, but that's not a genetic thing. Confidence goes a long way. \n\n\n>Why am I posting this? It\xe2\x80\x99s a cry for help. Oops, I forgot that men can\xe2\x80\x99t cry, so let\xe2\x80\x99s just say it\xe2\x80\x99s a call for help instead.\n\n\nYou seem to have toxic views on masculinity that you might be happier ditching. You don't need to be some hyper-ideal of manhood to be happy with your life. That being said, if you want someone to casually chat with, feel free to PM me. \n\n\n"""

"b'I got quite depressed today after seeing how people react to this type of article. On to the more important things. I do not care for supporting JP or any of his political-affiliations. JP is for normies;P I am just here to clarify the ontological-issue that is at stake. \n\n\n I am quite sure that Peterson was getting at the *technological-rationality/machination*. So what I think he was getting at is not particularly shocking to those who are familiar with continental philosophy. Post-war Heidegger (Breman and Freiburg lectures) and the Frankfurt School (e.g. Marcuse\'s One Dimensional Man) investigate the issue with such depth that it is distress-inducing. This *machination* played a substantial role in the staging and unfolding of WWII. So that\'s the reason I am being angsty.\n\n> why he appeals to centrists and Nazis alike\n\n\n The Nazis exploited the works of pretty much every great thinkers (JP is not one), poets, artists of the West .The Nazi had manipulated the way they in which the works were represented to promote their agenda. e.g. Entartete Kunst One could make a case (through arrangement of representations) for just about everything. Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche\'s works were taken out of context to promote the Nazi regime. That doesn\'t mean Plato isn\'t worth reading. A part of the danger is when the everyday engagement towards any political discussions only involve seeing things at face-value. It could be that we are always being busy, every insights that are not distanceless are immediately dismissed as pretentious. Technology is easy to use and accessible such that it is not necessary to think. A lot of people are so immersed in the drama (will-to-power cf.2) that they could not see what is at stake. The drama refers to the world-view that\'s been staged through the constant manipulations of representations everywhere. This disguising nature of technological-rationality is really the danger. This Ubyssey article is an example of the imposition of representations that conceals itself. I am quite sure that the writer might not have done it ""intentionally""- that\'s the scary part about the disguise.

In democratic elections of stable governments, there is no negotiating table in the sense that if there was a low majority it would somehow signal weakness and potentially cause a coup to overthrow the incumbent party. A union has opposition, namely the entity employing its members, and thus they can cease to exist if there was a low majority in much the same way less stable governments can trigger a regime change at the first sign of weakness, such as those you've mentioned.

- It would be *so easy* to use this as a springboard for ""Out of an abundance of caution and in response to calls from several university constituents, we have decided to implement a mandatory indoor mask policy on all UBC campuses when in-person instruction resumes,"" but that would unfortunately involve listening to students and staff

"b""Successfully relationship'd up on this end, although I admittedly entered university in a relationship. \n\nI have generally noticed that people who aren't exactly crushing it in the love life department tend to be doing similarly poorly as far as the socializing bit goes, in general. The two are certainly correlated. I don't necessarily mean that you don't have friends, but how frequently are you meeting new people? \n\nI used to tell people that the path to winding up in a relationship was to stop trying to get into a relationship - I still believe this, to a certain extent, because the majority of the successful relationships I'm aware of started when one or both partners swore off dating for a while and decided to work on themselves. What I now suggest is that if you're trying to get into a relationship, take a two-pronged approach. From one end of things, expand your social circle. Go out, meet new people, and do it with minimal expectations. Try not to be evaluating people for whether or not you'd date them. Take things as they come. It can be really awkward and frustrating to be trying to find a romantic partner in a setting where other people aren't looking for that. The other part is, put yourself in situations where everyone else is looking to find romance. Go to speed dating things. Sign up for online dating. It takes a lot of the difficulty out of the equation if you already know that the people on the other side of the whatever are open to you saying 'hey, do you want to grab a coffee this weekend'. \n\nAlthough, let's be real, your life is about to be consumed by a robot so maybe this isn't the best time to try to get involved with someone else. You'll wind up cheating on them with an oscilloscope and a tape-follower in a month or two. (Mostly kidding. Mostly.)"""

"b""I'm currently on Ritalin as I was diagnosed with ADHD when I transferred to UBC last year. The difference was like night and day between my grades from first and second semester. Addiction isn't an issue unless consumed in dangerous amounts (i.e. multiple tablets at once). It's strange because although medications like Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin etc. are labelled as stimulants, they're calming on the body. But with that said, it may help with focus but it does a lot to your heart rate and may increase anxiety. I'm someone who's fine asking questions in class but since taking Ritalin, I get so nervous to speak up and my heart pounds harder than ever. \n\nI gave my roommate some a few times during exams and she described the feeling as being more alert. I had another friend try some and he didn't notice a difference. It's best to consult a physician because they affect everyone differently. If you are going to try, don't do it the day of an exam. Try it out during a regular study session and note your heart rate, appetite, level of focus, possible anxiety attacks, sleep etc. Biased opinion (and mentioned by my doctor) but I think prescriptions like Adderall work best for those who consistently need it within and beyond an academic setting. \n\nTLDR; consult your family doctor."""

"b""there is hype everywhere. perhaps more in the business world, and hence business schools will want to capitalize on that...\n\npersonally i think ubc has been hyping itself well for the last couple of years, and their rankings seem to have gone up since my undergrad and masters there. with that comes certain benefits which actually does make it better for the students, so perhaps the hype is worth something.\n\ni used to be quite cynical about the sauder school back when i was there - partially because it seems to be predominantly two kinds of people: the more social ones tend to be obnoxious with money/connections (likely to be in a frat, etc), and type-A personalities who work super hard on getting grades but don't have any social skills at all and end up being obnoxious in other ways. however i should stress that this was perhaps a very limited view coming from outside the faculty (i did do a commerce minor, but that was mostly in courses with other non-sauder students). coming from engineering, of course we have our own share of annoying people...\n\nfor your second question, i would say ubc is one of the more inclusive campus communities. you'll definitely be able to find the right networks of support there if you reach out for them.\n\ni was on campus for about 10 years - started as an undergrad, took 6 years to finish with co-op and some noodling around, then did a 3 year masters and worked as a lab manager for a year. eventually realized i was sick of the place and finally moved on. doesn't mean i didn't enjoy the decade spent there at all, however..."""

"(Not important, Background): 

I am in cpen looking to land at a big tech companies. I am on my 4th coop work term and plan to keep doing coops until I land at big tech or the next summer.
The issue is I have no problems getting interviews from small or mid sized companies ( I feel like I can get 1 interview per 2/3 applications as right now I am getting lots of interviews which allows me to be very picky). However, I am not getting interviews from big techs ( apart from tesla, SAP at which I am waitlisted for fall and autodesk). Basically any company that uses ATS discards my resume.
My resume is highly parseable (I tested it on several APIs as well as on workday) which makes me think my resume is not key word optimized.
So I am thinking of hiring a professional resume service to keyword optimize my resume for certain jobs and learn the process. I am willing to spend upwards of 1k and even more if required.

(Main part) 

Has anyone hired or did anything similar for any jobs not necessarily in CS? Would you mind sharing your experience?

(Not Important, fyi): 

Also I know people will ask me to network which I already did with no avail. However my referrals (several senior swes at faang+ MSFT who know me personally) will be taking personal steps for next summer positions (talking with their supervisors as well as messaging appropriate hiring managers) so that might improve my odds but who knows.

My position is only available for students at certain universities\' Co-op programs.\n* As an international student, I can apply for a co-op work permit which allows me to work full-time outside of the summer time AND extend my study permit to account for the additional time I\'ll take to complete my degree.\n* You retail full-time student status during your work terms\n* Co-op internships are better viewed that summer jobs.\n* You graduate with the ""Co-op"" denomination/ title next to your degree. This carries weight in itself.\n* I actually found that most jobs pay above minimum. Personally, I am getting paid about $5.50 above.\n* BIG competitive advantage when you are searching for jobs after graduation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving said that, I admit that some of the postings they have on the internal job board are a bit nonsense.

For example, a university under this scoring criteria would **lose** points for promoting diversity, while to me, promoting diversity is undoubtedly a good thing. Some of the points give me the impression that the organization that created this criteria has a very certain narrative of what good campus practices would be in mind. It definitely gives me impressions of alt-right leaning motives. Ultimately though, this is an opinion, please do take time to evaluate for yourself.\n\nI think its up to you as individuals to determine whether the scoring criteria were fair, and to the degree which you agree with it.

Many other students have had positive experiences with the resources available, and everyone\'s journey of healing is going to be different, I ask respectfully that you bear that in mind before commenting. \n\n I think the systems in place at UBC are well-meaning but flawed. They weren\'t places I felt comfortable going after I was sexually assaulted, because the ""intersectional and anti-oppression"" lens doesn\'t leave much room for dealing with fraternity men as survivors of sexual violence.  I know for a fact I\'m not the only Greek who is a survivor, I know I won\'t be the last. \n\nUBC Counselling staff do a valiant job, and some of the staff there are woefully under-experienced to confront some of the horrible things that happen to UBC students. However, their job is the psychological and emotional equivalent of being a field trauma surgeon; to triage, to use finite resources to stabilize someone until they can find a more permanent source of support. Unfortunately, a lot of those more permanent sources are out-of-reach for many students; either because of stigma (esp. for male students, students from West, Southeast Asian  & East Asian backgrounds), cultural compatibility, and cost.  \n\nThere are other resources like peer groups and online tools like Empower Me but those aren\'t for everyone.

"b'Am girl in CS, complaints I heard about CS guys from other girls: \n\n(Note this isn\'t about the OP specifically, just generalized comments about CS guys.)\n\n\n1) Very unfashionable. You don\'t have to look like a model, but getting a **good haircut**, changing your clothes regularly, good hygiene, decent fashion sense would put you above by a lot. Basically just look put together and clean. Seriously. Most CS girls don\'t dress extremely fashionable either, so their fashion standards aren\'t super high for guys, but they still put a little effort in, while CS guys put zero in most of the time. \n(Not counting Asian exchange, they are hella fashionable. But they are incomparable and you don\'t need to go this far.)\n\n\n2) This is a funny one, but I\'ve heard numerous complaints about bad acne. I understand not everyone is blessed with good skin but guys using some product / cleaning face regularly / using medicine if acne gets bad would be a godsend. When girls have acne they try to take care of it most of the time. A lot of guys I know just ignore it and let their face become an asteroid. I have a friend who had really bad acne and the doctor prescribed her something and it worked wonders, so this is an option if your acne is getting really bad.\n\n\n3) Socially inept. Nothing wrong with being logical and reasonable, but this is not mutually exclusive with being empathetic, having tact and self awareness. CS guys sometimes lack this. Take a note from Steve Wolfman. :)\n\n\nAnd here\'s the thing, being smart and nerdy is not unattractive to women, especially to CS girls who are also nerds. Nerds like nerds man. Being an engineer/CS major is not a downside. HOWEVER it must be mixed with proper social etiquette and empathy. If you are smart, articulate, and a caring person who understands that women are individuals, even if you\'re not physically attractive women will still like you. The reason the ""girls don\'t like nerds"" stereotype pops up is because ""nerds"" sometimes act awkward and inappropriate. That is the part that is off putting, not their intelligence.\n\n\nBy the way, it\'s sad that Asian guys seem to think so lowly of themselves. There are tons of Asian girls in UBC and they usually don\'t shun Asian guys unless they have some sort of internalized racism. (Which some do, unfortunately. Westernized Asians are sometimes very racist towards Asians in their own race to separate themselves, but I won\'t go into that.) I don\'t think they\'re worth associating with if they do though.\n\n**TLDR:** Dress better, take care of acne, develop social skills and empathy. \nAlso nothing wrong with being Asian fam, c\'mon.'"

It\'s a society\\-wide issue that doesn\'t magically vanish in STEM fields.\n\nSo why offer this scholarship in STEM? 55&#37; of UBC undergrads are female as per a 2017 report. But roughly 3 quarters of people in Engineering at UBC are men. If we assume men and women are equally capable of being an engineer \\(and I hope we can agree on that\\), there should be no reason for a gap that large unless women are being discouraged from pursuing it by societal pressures. That\'s also probably why there are so many women in nursing: we usually think of engineering as a male profession and nursing as a female one.\n\nTo sum up, there\'s plenty of injustice to get mad about in the world that are a lot worse than a scholarship for women in STEM.'"

"b'Unpopular opinion:\n\nI don\'t hate international students, but I find it extremely annoying when international students wave their high tuition as if they deserve special treatment. It\'s crazy how much entitlement there is, there were international students last year who were demanding that the federal government gave them CESB, when the international students that were laid off from part time jobs even qualified for CERB (which is more than literally any other OECD economy was doing for int\'l students). \n\nIntl students: You pay higher tuition because you and your parents never paid a cent into our tax system and social contract prior to coming here. I do not care if you think that you\'re not getting value for your tuition dollars when UBC is online, if you don\'t like it, then transfer out. There are literally even better and cheaper universities that will happily give you a scholarship. If you really did contribute back to the social contract, you would\'ve applied for permanent residency. \n\nI understand the challenges of remote schooling. It sucks to take online classes at 2am but you have an option of who to pay tuition to. Literally nobody is forcing you to attend UBC. \n\nDomestic students pay lower tuition, but they pay taxes to fund the tuition of other students and their future children for the rest of their lives. You pay $30k a year, boo hoo. Many of us will pay taxes and work for Canadian businesses that pay taxes as well, for the rest of our lives. We will always be tax residents of Canada, paying even taxes on foreign income.\n\nIf you aren\'t complaining about deserving special treatment for being an international student, then I wholeheartedly welcome you, and I hope you apply for a post grad work permit and stick around. I am so happy to see humble international students become Canadians and join us in building a better future for us and our future generations. \n\nIf you\'re here because you couldn\'t pass the Gaokao and want ""value for your money"", then leave please.'"

"b'Good question.  I can\'t comment and what your specific instructor did, but here\'s my perspective as someone who assigns grades:\n\nYour grade is a measure of your meeting the learning goals of the course, and like any measurement, it has a measurement error associated with it.  Some sources of error include the grading process itself, which is (at least somewhat, often significantly) subjective, the creation of the assignments and exams (perhaps the exam gives more weight to the topics you\'re good at), the choice of relative weights to the course components, and also external forces like you having a bad day during a midterm,  missing an assignment due to a family emergency, or having a study group which helps on the homework.   Some learning goals are harder to evaluate than others.   \nConversely, repeated measurement and having uncorrelated errors helps, so we try to distribute the measurements and vary the modes of assessment: we combine  written assignments, online assignments, essays, classroom presentations, midterm and final exams and so on.\n\nMost of the time we can just ignore this imperfection.  As long as the method for assigning grades is reasonably transparent and fair, it\'s ok that it\'s not perfect.  If I slightly increase the weight of the final exam vs the homework it will slightly favour students who are good at exams and at working on their own as opposed to in groups, but while this consideration affects my choice of weights there is no obvious ""right answer"" to what the weights should be.  Since I can\'t measure learning perfectly, I don\'t worry whether the grade of 69 I assigned really reflects a ""true learning"" of 67 or 72.  It\'s not statistically meaninful to even ask the question.\n\nBut there is one point where this really matters: the difference between the grades of 49 and 50 is not incremental -- it is a very serious matter.  Assigning a grade like 49 doesn\'t simply tell the student ""your performance is about 49%"".  It tells the student: ""I am so confident in my ability to measure your performance that I am certain you are exactly 1% short of passing"", and for this reason professors are very reluctant to assign grades just short of 50.  This is not about pity -- it\'s about the limitations of the grading system.\n\nDoes that mean I automatically raise all 49s to 50s? No.  It means that I try to ""increase the precision"" by looking much more carefully at the work of the student during the term and the exams to try to be more confident about the correct mark. That said, I personally have a bias in favour of the student passing: I want to be confident the student has failed before assigning a failing grade (one can also imagine the opposite system, where I wouldn\'t pass the student unless I was confident they passed, but I don\'t know anyone who has that philosophy).'"

Hi everyone – students and professors. There's been a lot of conversation on here lately about how many of us are anxious about returning to campus. Case numbers in BC are rising, the Delta variant is becoming more and more prevalent, and modelling shows that hospitalizations could reach new record highs by the end of August. 

In order to keep everyone at UBC safe and healthy this fall, the university should make vaccinations mandatory for all students and staff, and require masks in indoor spaces. Please sign [this petition](http://chng.it/tSr44sfybr) (the link is also at the top of the post), so that the university can hear our voice and make the changes necessary to protect the entire UBC community.

Yet, I\'m finally graduating this term after 7 years in UBC.\n\nAm I successful? Debatable. Am I happy with where I am in life? yes.\n\nTo be honest at the end of the day, not everyone cares about other people. There isn\'t some mysterious groups of people judging your every move -- and if there are, they\'re wasting their time and energy judging others. What I mean to say is those who choose to judge people around every corner in life tend to be insecure themselves and are using their ability to put people down to bring them to their level. \n\nFor now, focus on yourself. I highly recommend seeing counselling at UBC. Having someone to talk to about what\'s on your mind really helped me. I recommend going to exercise when you can. I was a really lanky guy in 1st and 2nd year - like 5\' 11"", 130 pounds on a good day and my upper arm was as thick as my wrist. Nowadays I\'m much stronger than I was before. Going to the gym showed me how to plan for myself and take care of myself. Even just things like squatting and deadlifts made my back stronger so I have a much more confident posture in public. I\'m still a shy introverted guy, but I learned the power of being happy with who I am and where I am in the moment, and where I will be tomorrow.\n\nAt the end of the day, not everyone is going to be a DoctorLawyerBusinessmanAstronaut.

They haven\'t seen fit to mention this. \n* ""...which didn\'t violate any rules, was removed by the mods because it generated some controversy. Apparently the guidelines need to be updated.""\n * The guidelines do need to be updated! We\'re all sitting down together in late September to do just this. (No, we\'re not going to make it any more of a priority than that - we\'re unpaid and busy.) \n * It wasn\'t removed because it generated controversy! It was removed because we wanted OP to re-word it so it actually complied with the guidelines. As it stood, I think that it\'s pretty reasonable to say that it was at least a little bit low-effort and a little bit racist. So, I took it down. \n\n[\\(For anyone interested, here are the comments I made to OP, and the modmail after.\\)](https://imgur.com/a/LnP13)\n\n> It\'s a double standard and mods are arbitrarily removing posts.\n\nI am willing to concede that, right now, we have some double standards. I would like to point out that the reason we have these double standards is because we\'re several people who aren\'t all exactly on the same page. I would further like to point out that we do talk about this and we\'re trying to work on it (again, meeting up physically for the first time ever with everyone in late September) but that we\'re also only going to work so hard at it, because we\'re all busy and we\'re not getting paid. \n\nWhat I\'m not willing to concede is that this removal was arbitrary. The post was at least a little bit racist. The post was at least a little bit troll-y. \n\nWe asked OP to talk to us about how they could phrase their question so it would generate productive discussion. Instead, they gave us zero indication they were interested in talking with us and put us on blast in public, failing to mention that we had talked to them. \n\nDo the mods come off great in this situation? No. Do I think that the additional facts mentioned here make a difference? Yeah. \n\nBecause we can only have two stickies and we\'re using both of them, throw any mod concerns on /r/metaUBC/ and you have my solemn oath that there will be zero removal of any posts/comments for at least a week. There are other things that I want to do with the sub, so I reserve the right to nuke it from orbit, but that will happen with at least a week\'s warning so everyone can get their screenshots. \n\nHopefully this all sounds fair. If it doesn\'t, modmali or /r/metaUBC, please. \n\n---\n\nEDIT: oh, uh, the two linked posts.

Then I got home and I was hungry and I forgot about it. Whoops? \n\nThe \'who is actually from Vancouver\' post was definitely borderline, but it didn\'t blow up, and people actually seemed to like knowing where everyone else was from, so I hold that it was probably okay to leave it up - at least, it worked out in the end. \n\nAgain, we\'re aware of and working on consistency issues.

Sincerely hope you\'re able to repair your relationship tho.\n\nI can\'t offer much aside from my own experience. I was in a similar-ish position in term 1 of my first year where my relationship with my parents was deteriorating and I was feeling pressured to continue living with them despite the long commute and our many arguments.\n\nI did the big cultural no-no and moved out for term 2 and well beyond that, working roughly full time to try and pay for everything on my own. They didn\'t talk to me for a very long time.\n\nAt the time I wasn\'t the smartest and my parents did have access to my bank account where I had money saved up (some from me during high school but mostly from their inputs in the past) and with the amount of money there I wasn\'t really eligible for student loans.\n\nOBVIOUSLY looking back, I was in a privileged position to have money at all, but just off of principle (or out of spite tbh) I still worked to cover my own expenses to avoid dipping into what they had put into that account. I tried to cover tuition as well which meant working 2 jobs plus a casual gig over the summers. I did have to use some of the savings since I was averaging 2 breakdowns a week at certain points and needed to slow down.\n\nA few weeks before my fourth year I found myself in a terrible position and needed to move back in with my parents. Our relationship has improved but we still argue and it\'s still not easy when the same old shit crops up from the past, but in the end, they could have very easily not let me come back and just said ""good luck"". I hurt them a lot by moving out because it\'s just not culturally acceptable, but it was essential  for me at the time and I don\'t regret it, because now that I\'m back, I\'m able to contribute to their lives as an adult after what I learned, I proved to myself and to them that I can hold my own, and I\'m much more grateful for what they\'ve done for me despite their misgivings.\n\nI\'m South Asian, before you call me culturally tone-deaf. At the end of the day, if you can\'t communicate or deal with their presence in your life, you need to suck it up and start holding your own. If you can get yourself into debt via students loans, you\'ll have a chance of doing better in school than I did (I fucked up a lot in terms of grades tbh), but you\'ll need to take on a job for other expenses. They\'re probably going to be pissed off and may seriously not talk to you, but this kind of sounds like what you want anyway so you should be aiming for independence.\n\nSaying you aren\'t allowed to do something that\'s entirely lawful is what children do. You\'re reaching a critical point where you have to learn to make decisions that you know will be best for you, like an adult, rather than being bitter, like a child.\n\nI mean this nicely, and I do hope things work out for you.'"

UBC is massive and feels like a city in itself. Comparing Vancouver and Toronto has been really cool too.\n+ Campus is incredible, I really can't get over it. Vancouver and all the benefits you already know are all so mindblowing, the mountains are your playground. \n* You meet so many international people at UBC, a visiting Queens friend was shocked at how many different people go to the school.\n\n\nYour concerns about not feeling like a community at UBC is pretty legitimate, I don't think we have the best school spirit. Once your faculty kind of narrows down you feel a sense of community because you start to recognize the same people in different classes, and if you join clubs or teams there's obvious communities there.

This is all deaths since the beginning of the pandemic by age in Canada, most of which had no vaccine. If you are vaccinated, you are incredibly safe now.

It is also worth mentioning that 0-29 made up \~40% of all confirmed cases, and likely more than that.

You can't just trust the science when it aligns with your beliefs. Vaccines work. Because they work, you really have no business telling other people what to do. You are not in danger.

Edit: This post is not to dismiss people's worries, but to put them in perspective. Most students are in far more danger driving to school than being at school.

"Okay, this is probably going to sound kind of stupid but I want to get it off my chest.

I’ve just finished my second year at Langara and I’m beginning to wonder if I’m actually as studious as reflected by my grades.
Just to provide some background, I was always an A student in high school, except for pre-calc (although I wasn’t terrible) and I have continued to receive high grades throughout my two years of post-secondary. I do tend to get quite anxious over everything and I’m sure this is a large part of the reason for all this self-doubt.
I’m starting to feel as though I’m coming by these grades too easily, and I KNOW this is going to sound like I’m fishing for praise and all, but I’m genuinely struggling with these feelings. I consistently receive grades within the A-/A/A+ range (85-100 give or take, I can’t remember lol) and I have a GPA of 4.33 (idk if UBC does that or if they stop at 4.0). Yet there is a little voice in the back of my head telling me that the only reason I’m doing so well is because this is a community college and that I wouldn’t last a day in university. Obviously, I know this isn’t the case,
as there really is no difference in the quality of education, but I can’t help but feel like a phony.
Idk maybe I’m just rambling.

TL;DR doing very well academically, can’t help but feel like I’m coming by things too easily and that this is a reflection of the quality of my education."

The absolute best thing you can do for yourself even before committing and putting time and effort to this road is to at least see what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing and whether this profession is appealing to you. \n\nTrust me, it sounds harsh, but the medical world is NOT all it seems on Greys Anatomy or Scrubs or whatever shows they have on CBC/CTV.

Followed by him pointing out that there actually is a gap, but it is only due to the fact that women and men choose different careers. *Not* followed by a further investigation as to why men and women seem to gravitate towards certain careers, and whether there may be societal factors that influence their choices.\n\n-Abortion=bad\n\n-No sex until marriage\n\n-Says not to victim-blame! follows up immediately by suggesting women shouldn\'t go to parties with alcohol if they don\'t want to get sexually assaulted.

If you were to email Karina and Geoff with your concerns I'm sure they would take that into account to clarify the next exam, and maybe revisit the wording on these questions to make rubric changes.

"Have any questions about Islam burning a hole in your pocket? The perfect opportunity has arrived, it’s Reddit AMA time! Join the Muslim Students' Associations from UBC, SFU, UofS and Memorial University on Tuesday, March 9th at 11 AM PST for a QnA session with Abdullah Al-Andalusi! MSA UBC is working in collaboration with MSA SFU, UofS MSA, Memorial University MSA and the United IAW Org for United Islam Awareness Week- a campaign in which we aim to reclaim the narrative, dispel misconceptions, and spread the true message of Islam!

How does it work?

* Send in your question in this thread

* Head to https://www.unitediaw.com/ and hear the answer LIVE @ 11 am PST

* If you were unable to catch the live session, we will also post the answers here.

Abdullah Al-Andalusi is an international speaker, thinker and intellectual activist for Islam and Muslim affairs. His work involves explaining and demonstrating, by rational argument, the intellectual proofs for the Islamic belief system, and promoting the Islamic way of life and Islamic solutions for contemporary problems. Abdullah is of Portuguese and French/Colonial North African descent, and was formerly a Christian until he embraced Islam at 14 after a period of study that started when he was 10 years old. He has continued to study Islam in depth ever since.

You are forced to act kind and be nice towards those people. Eventually over time, this causes your implicit attitude to change as well, also due to exposure to the out group when you are forced to be nice to them and be around them. \n\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s an example: I went to a very very very religious high school. I went for the academics. The school was very right wing and conservative. I had a class of almost thirty people discuss vaccines, and almost all of them believed that God would protect them, and forcing people to get vaccinated was against their rights. Not only that, I knew many kids who thought gay people could be turned straight, trump was A-Ok, and I had a teacher once tell me that all muslims would be terrorists if they followed the Quran.

I am surprised that some people are willing to accept privacy issues this casually: obviously, an asinine gender and identity politics reading of Jane Austen is not likely to lurch up from a government database, but critical political science, Latin American Studies or Middle Eastern Studies papers of American foreign policy might.  I am not saying that you will be placed on a future ""no fly/no entry"" list because of those angry anti-American essays you wrote when you were 20 and thought you were a Social Justice Warrior, but it certainly does not extend beyond the realm of possibility.  \n\nThe point about data-mining is that no one really knows what happens to the information, where it goes, who owns it, and when it will ever be used again.  Governments historically have spied, and will continue to spy, upon student populations.  I really only included that bit about the USA PATRIOT Act to express the most glaring potential privacy concerns while indicating that other Canadian campuses have taken action against using the service.\n\nFor my own purposes, I take great issue with the presumption of guilt, invasion of privacy, profiteering off student labour -- you are actually paying to take a course, to write a paper, to freely supply it for a company that will then profit off you with no material compensation -- and the inadequacy of the software to accurately determine plagarism. \n\nThe program is actually really awful.  It can detect gross plagarism - copying entire paragraphs, sentences, other papers verbatim - but it also has extra-ordinarily high instances of false positives. The appeal process is also not setup in students interests: it is actually quite difficult to appeal a course, or a grade, since faculty on principle do not like to interfere with each other\'s courses -- and the claim of academic misconduct (even if faulty) is all one needs to dismiss a potential challenge.\n'"

However, if you don't have the foundation, you're not going to be able to do that. \n\nCalculus 1 is, for whatever reason, always a bit of a game-changer for people who have never done calculus before. It's a bit like learning a new language: the fact that you speak English very well isn't going to help you, because you don't actually understand how languages work - the parts of speech, grammar, and all that.

That they hate just sitting around on their first friday night at campus in almost 2 years. And believe me, I've felt a bit of that myself, moving here for the first time and not having anybody.

So I've been thinking, since there are so many of us in this boat, why don't *we all* go out to either a bar or see if another brave redditor wants to host a party, so we can make some friends and enjoy our time at uni while we can? I propose that we all coordinate a bar/house to go to Saturday night so we can get out, have some fun, and meet new like minded people. I get that meeting one person online can be weird, but if a ton of us go somewhere it could be really awesome, and best of all, we're all in the same shoes just trying to make friends, so everyone would feel welcome.

There was some argument about having urinals in the gender neutral bathroom, and someone pointed out that its a waste of resources to build something only half the people could use when anyone can piss in the toilet. '"
"b'Same way how people who get rejected from UBC, the Ivies, Law School, etc live. Because they know that in the long run their own strive for improvement will last much longer and benefit them much more than short term humiliation and failure. My suggestion is to stop putting your own identity on your extrinisic achievments(getting into med school for one) and put it more on intrinsic qualities. Learn to love and respect your own tenacity to strive for your goals, after all I already respect you for keeping up your GPA because honestly its hard as shit as a lot of first years learn. Your basiclly being discrimitory to yourself, you\'ve done stuff that someone less succesful than you would kill to have, but your disregarding your current successes for a future POTENTIAL failure. Even if you don\'t get into med school there are a myriad of ways to go for a different path. The most succesful person isn\'t the one who sulks in the face of his future but still keeps all his baskets on med school, its the person who has faith in their own abilities but always makes sure for a backup plan anyways. Many entrepeneurs spend years of hard work and stress to build a company and most of them still go out of business or are sold off, yet the most succesful ones (elon musk) are the ones who got right back up from rock bottom anyways. And if its your parents or other people who are pressuring you so hard to get in that you feel like not getting in would lose their approval, realise you don\'t need anyones approval but your own. And I assure you 90 percent of people don\'t care if you get in or not, they only start making fun of you if you stay a failure by not trying to improve yourself anyways. Fun is something every normal person wishes everyone else to have, and your limiting yourself based off misguided anticipation. You can\'t time travel so you don\'t know how your life will end up anyways. So stop worrying this much and learn to love yourself. People who truly love themselves have the highest chances of success due to boosted confidence and risk taking. I know what your going to ask ""How will I love myself if I fail getting into med school"" and you do that by accepting the fact that you might not get in and come to terms with the possibility of a career change, but still try as hard as your powerful soul lets you and learn to respect your own strengths.  Med school rejects almost everyone, but a selfish higher love for yourself helps everyone. Never believe that your efforts are ""pointless"", as long as you draw breath and can form a single thought or action your efforts WILL lead you closer to your goals. The day that you give up in the face of failure is the true day your efforts will become pointless. In other countries and places people have problems filling their mouth with food or even living past the next day, yet they still persevere. Are you really going to get in your own way and let something much less life-imposing make you feel like giving up? The entire point of growing up and going to uni is forming your identity and personal strength, but you still sound like you care about what other people say about you. This is a problem I had to, and I remedied it by realizing I was being selfless to a fault. We are raised to be ""good"" people and take account people\'s criticisms and compliments because we need to consider other people like how we consider ourselves. So naturally a personal insult or shit talking hurts. This is bullshit, a little bit of selfishness in life is good for you. Train yourself to disregard these words because in the end, unless these people want to actually physically harm you, you will still be moving forward. Your life is short, don\'t waste time on words from people you barely respect or like.'"

Ideally, you\xe2\x80\x99re strong in all areas, but if you are strong enough in some areas that might offset your GPA, especially if your GPA shows improvement. The most important thing is that you\xe2\x80\x99re able to find a good enough fit and have faculty members at the school you\xe2\x80\x99re applying to agree that you\xe2\x80\x99d be a good fit.

"I hate how when people express their reluctance to go straight back to in-person classes in September, we'll get told there's nothing to fear, or to just deal with it.

UBC will not mandate masks, or vaccinations but will effectively mandate in-person attendance for most students. Do people really not understand why some of us are reluctant? 

I'm happy people who hated online school and had deteriorating mental health will get to go back to in-person classes. I'm glad you have that option now. I just want UBC to give us some options too. You know what also f-cks with mental health? Not being able to vaccinate for legitimate reasons yet forced to attend huge lecture classes. Commuting for hours on busses or trains with no social distancing. Worrying about getting covid and passing it on to vulnerable loved one. Having our concerns ignored or minimized. 

Yes, BC is supposedly on a good trajectory right now. The fall semester might turn out perfectly ok (and I hope it does), but that's based on the assumption that everything is going to go according to plan. Am I worrying too much? Maybe. But honestly, so what? Is it so unreasonable to want some extra options or precautions in place for a few months as we transition (or more accurately, thrown) back to in-person learning? Imagine wanting a little extra leeway when we literally are still going through a worldwide pandemic where millions of people died while many others are still suffering long-term effects?!?! WHAT A WEIRDO.

EDIT: Thanks to the few who responded kindly. 

It's funny how some seem to have loads of empathy with those who will not vaccinate for selfish reasons and can spread the virus to others, but not for the rest of us. UBC gets ragged on all day every day, but when it comes to this, suddenly you are UBC's greatest defender.

Also, unless you are a professor, stop repeating that UBC is not an online school. As much as I dislike it, I can understand how this affects them (e.g. workload, classroom  pedagogy) and I respect that. These are not things that affect you in any way. I don't understand why you are so against UBC offering online OPTIONS, unless it's because you think if students are not forced to be there in person, you'll find out you actually don't really have friends in real life?"

"  

First of all, this isn’t about Ian. What he has gone through I would not wish upon anyone.

Secondly, this is not a defence of Proctorio. They have shown themselves to be a predatory company with questionable ethics and poor leadership.

My concern around the AAPS board decision to fund the defence of Ian is based on the fact that this establishes a precedence that I’m not sure the well-meaning board members and executive thought through. First and foremost, I am fairly confident that Ian’s role as a Learning Technology Specialist within the Faculty of Education does not state anywhere that posting on social media is part of his job description. This means I believe that what he did, he did as a private citizen, not as an employee of UBC and so should not be accepting monies for his defence fund. 

The other more scary part of this is does this open the doors for other UBC staff members to voice our opinions on social media, confident that if we say something that one of our vendors, or the institution itself does not like, AAPS is going to be there? If this is the case, then I look forward to that day when I can put my real name in social media to share shit that I’ve seen and I know. I’m sure students and taxpayers would be interested…

And when is AAPS going to share with the membership the reasons why this decision was made? I do hope the board members and the executive will issue a release justifying this decision. How much money or ours did they commit to? I believe in their hearts they may have made the right decision, but again they have ventured into territory I for one don’t believe they thought through, nor understand the consequences."

" I am looking for suggestions on what to do after going to public places or using transit in order to maximize safety. What I mean is...

**1) What do you do with the clothes you just wore after using public transit or going to public places?**

Do you immediately throw those clothes into the laundry hamper as to mark it unsafe to wear or would you actually consider wearing those same clothes the next day (or even the next two days)?

**Note:** The premise of the follow-up question is assuming one doesn't sweat a lot during that day so the clothes aren't sweat scented.

**2) Do you shower immediately afterwards upon arriving home? What if you need to go out twice a day?**

For example, suppose you had work in the morning and you have to go eat dinner with someone, would you shower at least twice? Once upon arriving home for work and once upon arriving home for dinner.

Additionally, say you are morning-showerer (i.e. you take showers in the morning as part of the morning routine), would you shower three times that day in the above situation (where you had to leave home twice)?

Reason I ask is because I plan to take public transit to commute back from and to UBC and all courses are in-person. So, I am currently looking for tips to reduce the risk and stuff."

I don't understand why rather than denouncing the *creators* of the Jewish state or the disgustingly racist views towards the Jewish people that is ubiquitous in the Middle East, Israeli people and businesses are demonised. \n\nYes, the current regime in Israel is repulsive, but sanctions that will only hurt honest working *individuals* is absolutely not the answer.\n\nPerhaps I've misunderstood what your aim is, but that's my take"""

"b""TLDR; From my honest perspective it is impossible to take these specific courses and still get that amount of sleep on most nights.\n\nDid you get credit for 5 courses?? If you have transfer credit there's no reason to overload.\n\nAlso don't take unnecessary electives.  I accidentally took an extra one in first year although transfer credit covered all the lower-level electives.\n\n~~~~\n\nCpsc 110 is a large time commitment. In addition to in-person lectures you also have a longggg lab every week (which requires prepping in advance), as well as video lectures you must watch at home, homework, studying for exams, etc.  if you're going into comp sci you need it, though.  If you find the coursera videos you can start those this summer.\n\nI haven't taken the other courses but it sounds like a heavy courseload in general.  Also with these courses you are going to be going back and forth across the whole campus on rainy days.  Oftentimes you don't have much of an option in first year because of requirements in different faculties, though :/\n\nI also usually need 10 hrs sleep minimum due to lupus, and if I consistently get less it ultimately leads to organ damage.  In first semester first year I put a lot of time into courses (sleeping 7 hours occasionally, but usually less); it ended up backfiring as I ended up quite sick and then had no choice but to miss a few weeks of school for lupus/ lung complications.  If you are very serious about needing this amount of sleep you will need to make some sacrifices in other aspects of your life, but also consider what courseload is realistic.  There's only so much you can accomplish with 13 hours per day; if you are living on campus you may also need to consider the time to do things you possibly aren't doing now- vacuuming, grocery shopping, cooking, laundry, etc.\n\nSide note; In first year you will want to put time into meeting new people; as a graduating student the friends I made my first few weeks are still the people I'm closest to.  It is an important aspect of mental health. That support system is going to be important.  It doesn't have to be drinking/partying but maybe someone you can occasionally play board games with, or go to the dorm caf together.  Maybe someone in a class to bounce ideas off of, or someone that enjoys the same type of exercise."""

If you do end up being accused of cheating, then it is best to fess up, but if they don't know and aren't directly accusing you, I don't see why you would give yourself away.\n\nFor now, realise it's completely out of your hands. Either they're going to try and investigate more and maybe they'll catch you, or maybe they won't investigate more. I know it's easier said than done, but try not to think about it, there's nothing you can do now, and you can't predict the future and what might happen. Also know that if you do end up being caught, (if this is your first offence) it's not like you're going to be kicked out. At worst you might fail the class, which sucks but really isn't the end of the world.\n\nAlso try to have some compassion for yourself as it is likely the shame causing you to focus so intently and worry about this. A lot of people cheat. As we have seen. You're not the first to cheat and you won't be the last. People make mistakes, bad judgement calls, and do things they usually never would in times of high stress. It doesn't mean you're a bad person. It's good to know that you should never cheat again, but forgive yourself for this time. \n\n Last year I copied someone's code for an assignment off of github and got caught. I got a 0 on that assignment and it's all in the past now. I learnt to never copy someone else's answer again. \n\nHonestly, there are a lot worse things you could do than cheat, so just try to be compassionate with yourself and try to put it out of your mind.

Well obviously you still have to do well on GRE, GMAT, LSAT, etc depending on what you want to do in future.\n\nSo to answer your question, people who get accepted to top American university are someone who had particularly different experiences than other applicants.\nFor instance, the applicant who had work experience tends to get accepted over the other applicants who just directly apply from undergrad.\nDifferentiation is the key to answer your question.\nHopefully my idea helps when you come to UBC and apply for grad school later.'"

Thus, some of your courses will be on Connect and some on Canvas.  \n\nOne of the reasons why Connect is being replaced is because it is slow, hard to use, and lacks many features that professors need.

"b""Several points.\n\n1. If you are the typical 20-year-old undergraduate, then \\*your\\* risk of getting ill is very small already, and your risk of a serious illness is tiny.  1/20th of that is smaller yet, so indeed you might think you shouldn't be terribly worried about your classmates being vaccinated.  BUT you are about to spending hours on end sitting next to other people in closed poorly ventilated spaces.  The risks on campus are not comparable to the risks when the disease is well-controlled. You can also manage your risk: class attendance mostly isn't mandatory.\n2. But if you are a typical 60-year-old professor then your risk of getting ill is high, and your risk of serious illness is, well, serious.  Even 1/20th of that is a pretty big risk.  I'm far from that, but on the other hand I won't get a choice in the fall: I will have to go in the classroom and teach.\n3. Even if the individual in question has a small risk, they might have household members or people they care for who are at high risk.  For people who have an elderly relative at home, or whose life partner is immunosuppressed for some reason, it is \\*crucial\\* they don't bring the disease home even if they themselves are not at great risk.\n4. A covid outbreak on campus would be immensely disruptive.  Imagine what would happen if hundreds of students were self-isolating in the dorms while faculty were scrambling to offer them an online option.\n\nThe bottom line is that people who cannot get the vaccine for various reason is why vaccination should be \\*required\\* from those who can.\n\nRegarding your point about international students, at least right now BC is vaccinating anyone physically present regardless of their immigration status.  Maybe international students will have to arrive a couple of weeks early if they want to get vaccinated by the start of classes, but given that they have the option we can require it of them.\n\n[https://immunizebc.ca/ask-us/questions/covid-19/i-am-not-resident-bc-i-am-bc-right-now-am-i-eligible-get-vaccine](https://immunizebc.ca/ask-us/questions/covid-19/i-am-not-resident-bc-i-am-bc-right-now-am-i-eligible-get-vaccine)"""

Courses with enrollments over 60 are basically guaranteed to be online only.

Even if you swore you wouldn't communicate with other students so you can just write the same exam, there's no way for the professor to enforce that.

"\*\* update: not talking about people who have refused the vaccine, I am talking about people who cannot get it for various reasons.

edit: Also, can someone explain why if I get 2 does of the Pfizer vaccine, which is \~95% effective, why I would still be at risk for covid? 5% chance of developing symptoms is pretty low. My current mindset, and part of the reason I feel like it shouldn't be mandatory, is that once I receive the vaccine I am at very low risk for developing covid, and should not worry. Is this wrong?

Unpopular opinion, but I do not think UBC should require students to be vaccinated this fall.

I support scientific and medical research (and as a science student understand it enough to develop my own opinions based on the data and research), and will be getting the vaccine myself when it is available, however IMO it should not be mandatory at UBC for a few reasons.

1. UBC is a public institution, and from my own research it seems to be against the Canadian Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms to force all students to be vaccinated, as well as go against religious freedom for some people [https://thehumlawfirm.ca/can-employers-require-employees-to-get-the-covid-vaccine/](https://thehumlawfirm.ca/can-employers-require-employees-to-get-the-covid-vaccine/)
2. International Students may not be able to receive the vaccine in their home country by September, and with the timeline of vaccine rollout in Canada consistently changing, and Pfizer now approved for kids over 12, it may not be feasible for Canada to offer vaccines to international students by September. (edit: after Canadians who want it receive 2 doses, I sure hope it will be offered to other countries. )

I feel like it is not fair for UBC to only allow international students back who are vaccinated, because it punishes students who live in a place where they have not had the opportunity to receive the vaccine.

anyways, I hope this post sparks debate and I would love to hear why you agree or disagree with any of these reasons! Let me reiterate I am not anti-vax, and I support getting the vaccine. I just do not think it should be mandatory for UBC students in September."

"Imagine if a course has these policies:   

* Our lowest scoring quiz is excluded from the calculation of our grade. 
* Each quiz is scaled so that the class average of each quiz remains constant. 
* It is unclear if the professor will exclude blank quizzes from the calculation of the class average.  

Heading into the final quiz, it seems that some of my classmates are happy with their first few quizzes, and so plan to skip the final quiz. Is it ethical for these classmates to try to get only a couple points on the final quiz to 

1. ensure their score will be calculated in the class average, and
2. to lower the class average so that students who are trying for the final quiz get curved to a higher mark? 

Would it be ethical to encourage this behavior, and to not point out this loophole to the professor?  

Put another way, I'm having a moral dilemma on whether or not it's ethical to not try your hardest on an exam. In sports this would be a bit analogous to match fixing. On the other hand, it's an opportunity to help other students without any personal gain. 

I don't believe this behavior is covered in the academic misconduct rules of the calendar.

"There exist cases with masks and sanitizer and the spread of the virus can never be fully escaped by masks only, even fully equipped. I did the group project about Coronavirus, the relatively confined space prolonged contact transmission, respiratory droplets, exposure to virus-contaminated objects are all the dangerous factors of spreading  (Chinese People's Liberation Army Anti-epidemic Expert Group) Unfortunately, classrooms perfectly encompass these properties. Also, virus spreading during transportation should not be ignored, especially since the public transportation system is not vaccination-mandatory. Also, there are cases in class of an anonymous post by UBC students, but none of the faculty and the president cares. There is one confirmed case for students in S.R.C, which is the place that 800+ people take one exam together. Scientifically, isn't a larger classroom to make people stay 150min together a placebo?

This is a really simple game theory/behavioural economic conception: people with covid will tend to they are uninfected to get marks, and all positive cases are positive, but the testing itself is the conditional signal. The final outcome because of the pandemic's externality is the worst one, a lose-lose stage (the existing positive case will be less likely to perform normally, and the other students increase the risk of infection. Also, I think only a few of the students experience COVID more than I do. After quarantine in China, I was trained and became the volunteer of my community to the people who came back from the other countries last academic year (2021.2-2021.5), and I also participated in the NGO funding to Wuhan in 2020. In addition, if the faculty staff and higher tier leaders deem this is a risk-free campus and so does exam locations, I would strongly suggest they should work in the close space with hundreds of people from elsewhere in Vancouver and tell us they feel safe, like what the decisions they made to treat the students.

As an international student, all I could do is watch the tragedy that previously happened in China occur again in Canada and even much worse. That's not the students' fault. Luv the university, luv the High tier leaders. they want to make the elephant in the room invisible and just make dollar bills from our tuition to get more dividents. Luv you UBC."

"b'I see this type of post come up around every election season. I know that you feel strongly about this issue, but it is definitely an exaggeration to state that student societies have not done anything for you and that they do not improve the quality of the university.\n\nFor example, the Abdul Ladha building, the Engineering Student Centre, the Meekson Arts Student Space (MASS) and the (eventual) Arts Student Centre are all things that undergraduate societies have overseen and/or executed. Without the advocating, planning, and organization of these student societies, there would not be these spaces for students to associate with people in their faculty. I know lots of people that eat there, hang out with their friends, and host events at these places. The funds used to build these projects came from donors, alumni, and current students to make our university campus better. The funds that you are paying to your student society will go to future projects that will eventually make the university better for future students. So, to be honest, I think it is a bit selfish that you are infuriated that your funds are going towards your student society. \n\ninb4 ->  ""oh but I don\'t use these spaces or go to any events that are there so I shouldn\'t have to pay anything"" \n\nOkay even if you do not use these spaces or regularly attend events with your student society, you should still have to pay your student fees. There are so many workshops, events, activities, and conferences that happen in these spaces that positively affect other students that it would be really rude to take that away from them. Take the recent AUS connect with tech event that partnered with RED academy for example. It was an event that was funded by the AUS to help students who want to use their arts degree to get into the tech industry. One of my friends went to this event expecting it to be subpar at best but walked away with some really good connections in the industry and an idea of what she wanted to do after grad. \n\nI do agree with you though that sometimes the people in these student leadership positions are incompetent. However, there are many execs in these student societies that do amazing work! We really only hear about student societies on the /r/UBC subreddit when they fuck up because we love drama. But the positive aspects of them are never showcased and the people who are doing really good jobs never get shoutouts. \n\nOk anyways rant over. \n\n**TL;DR:** It comes off as a bit ignorant that you want to stop paying your student society fees because it impacts more than just you and does improve the quality of the university.\n'"

If you failed a year N course and want to take the re-take the course in year N+1, you are not going to be competing with other year N+1 students. Thus the registration time you get won't be relevant. \n\nLike, suppose you failed MATH 100 in first year and you're registering to re-take it in the summer. As a first year, [you'd be registering on March 8th](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/registration-dates). Now, suppose your registration time is really shitty, like 12:30 or something.

Granted, it is certainly not easy to keep track of everything at once (i have a similar courseload as you do, except PHYS courses instead of PHIL, plus being a TA and an RA). Everyone will forget about due dates - for me I notoriously missed the CPSC 320 prereading quizzes until the last minute (and sometimes past that.) I might also recommend working with other people in the same class if you're not already, so you can study with each other and those conversations can both help de-stress, be productive, and encourage all parties involved to not forget about due dates. And for me, adding things into Google Calendar right as I find out about them, and usually a separate list of weekly tasks for each class, helped me stay organized. It might (or might not) help you as well. \n\nIt sounds like a break might be a good choice. Hopefully this summer provides that opportunity for you.

Wolf is, at least, 100% right in saying that UBC is a racist, colonial institution that exists illegally on stolen land, for which they pay no rent and make little apology for occupying. I personally have been told BY MY PROFESSORS that residential schools were a good thing, that there aren’t Indigenous students in the classroom, and that colonialism is over. It is difficult to describe to settler students what the Indigenous experience at UBC is, and I’ll add the caveat that my experience and opinion is just one of thousands, and Indigenous peoples/experiences are non-monolithic. 

With that being said, when this controversy first popped up about a month ago, neither I nor any of the other Indigenous students I talked were surprised that it appeared UBC was attempting to silence an Indigenous professor. It has happened before and will happen many more times. Again, we hear bad settler takes on Indigenous issues all the time. Cue the downward spiral into ~whatever the fuck is happening~, which I am generally trying to ignore. 

I am mostly here to talk to other Indigenous students about how this situation has us feeling. I am your classic west coast mutt and I am also light-skinned, and all this nonsense about DNA tests and Indian status and “proving your are Indian enough” has me really hurt and upset. It is so clear a lot of the settlers on this subreddit have no clue about Indigenous identity or Indigenous issues. Also, raceshifting and false claims to indigeneity are serious issues, and it truly seems like there is a constant stream of white people lining up to claim indigeneity to receive funding/job opportunities/clout/access to indigenous knowledge, especially in academia. 

So I would love to hear from other Indigenous students. I know I at least have felt very very isolated during this whole situation, with even my close settler friends not understanding why the ignorance in this conversation is hurtful.

PS: I love you, all my Indigenous homies. This is hard and with nothing being in person it is even harder to feel in community at UBC. Stay strong <3"

>**""Canadian** government research estimates that **international students** contribute some $22 billion annually to the country's economy and help to sustain over 170,000 jobs."" - CIC News

Hosting international students is one of Canada's biggest industries. I think a common sense government would at least *think* very very hard, of a way September 2021 can be in-person. The Canadian government could give them vaccines, cheap quarantine accommodations, and it would still be beneficial for the economy. 

There are around 1 million full-time university students in Canada, and there are 3.4 million canadians in the age of 18-24. If university students (who have classes in high risk settings, probably more than most of the other 18-24 y/os) are prioritized in that age group so that we can receive vaccinations in early August, we can save the multi-billion dollar industry. 

The risks of prioritizing university students clearly outweigh the benefits. It's a $38 billion dollar enterprise and it is crucial for this generation to receive proper education.

Is the government, who ***just*** are starting to \*\*plan\*\* mandatory hotel quarantine, going to start planning for this logistical challenge? Probably not because they're too slow and dumb compared to countries like Taiwan and South Korea. If other countries like SK, UK, US, EU start having in-person classes while we just sit in our rooms, then I'm going to be extra depressed. 

Although we have lost many of our senior Canadians, the younger generations took one of the biggest sacrifice. We spent over a year of our prime time in isolation. And because of a government who clearly were not ready for a pandemic, our national debt is over a trillion dollars; it's increasing at $10,000 per second. **Guess who's gonna pay for that? Us, who are going to have another semester of online school and feel like shit for another four months, if not life time.**

For the sake of our future and the future of our country, **we NEED better education.** That's my conclusion. The government should at least work their ass off to make Fall 2021 happen.

If the government really cares about students and the Canadian university industry, they should put us in priority and put some accomodation. We are future taxpayers and you guys, the government, owe a lot to us. It's hard to listen to online classes if i know that my salary in the future would be going towards paying the national debt.

The spread in the UK is more in their younger, unvaccinated population, as UK prioritized second doses whereas BC tried to give everyone first doses before prioritizing second doses.

I'll post the same response (heavily edited down) here.\n\nI've been working for a few months at a fast-growing startup as a software developer. I'm from a completely self-taught background. I'll be entering the BCS program this year in order to strengthen my theoretical knowledge base, work on some projects to acquire specific skills that I want, and to grow a network in the CS area.\n\nI like software development not because of the programming, but because it enables me to solve a problem that you can't do without computers. It's insanely empowering to look around my surroundings and think of all the things that I could automate. There is no shortage of problems to solve - the only barrier is in your own skills and desire to learn & experiment. It is also a meritocracy where your salary scales with your ability to tackle complex problems efficiently and effectively. This works well with me because I am ambitious, desire intellectual stimulation, and HATE being bored with simple, repetitive tasks. I also really enjoy being a part of a small team, where some days I have more of a supporting role, and other times where I realize that the entire team is depending on me. The responsibility is exciting. I don't necessarily have a burning passion for the computer sciences (otherwise I'd be pursuing research - but I won't rule that out just yet), but I do have a passion for seeing my efforts solve challenging real-world problems. CS education to me is an enabler - a means to an end.\n\nIn terms of differentiating between companies to work at, material things such as salary and perks are irrelevant once it exceeds a certain comfortable level. From that point on, I look carefully at what the work culture is like and who I'll be surrounding myself with every day. I will also look at the problems that the company needs to solve and judge how well my motivations align with theirs.

From personal experience, SJ circles among especially young people can get rather cliquey, but everyone is a part of some mind (including the virulent denial at the centre of anti-SJW rhetoric).\n\nI enjoy some of the lengthier pieces, especially concerning tangible issues (Indigenous students on campus, on tuition raises, on reasons to resist, etc) but again, I wish there was more news and investigation. I also think social justice, i.e. organizing with people to remedy the injustice in this world is for everyone, and should be accessible to everyone, but I'm not sure how much of there's an ongoing effort to reach out across the kids on campus. \n\n**tl;dr** Despite its flaws, it's needed, and mostly good-intentioned."""

"So in my infinite hubris I decided to take Math 223 first term, and Math 220 and 200 second term.  This was because I already had credit for first year math courses and I wanted to get them out of the way. What I didn't anticipate was how hard some had made out Math 223 to be, which I'm now scared of because I'd like to specialize in CS, which requires a competitive GPA in first-year. I would say my math background is fairly solid; I wrote math contests throughout highschool and placed well regionally.  Nothing national-tier though. What I'm asking is how hard is the workload going to be and am I going to have to no-life study to make the cut for CS?

Edit: What I ended up doing was dropping MATH 200 and 220 and taking MATH 226 first term instead.  I also dropped PHYS 106 for PHYS 131 second term because it took up the same time slot as MATH 226. This heavily front loads my courses but honestly I think I'd prefer taking MATH 226 over PHYS 106."

"b""From a girl's perspective:\n\n1.  There are girls and guys alike who that might matter to, but do you really want to spend time/have a relationship with those kind of people?  I personally don't have any female friends who this matters to, but that's just my circle.\n\n2.  Shouldn't matter at all.  If you are friendly and considerate before telling someone you're an engineer, it won't matter.  If anything, being an engineer is a plus because it's a decent indicator that you're intelligent.  (Clarification, being an engineer will never get you a girlfriend, but it should gain you a few points if you're not a socially inept asshat).\n\n3.  Dressing blandly definitely loses you points on first impressions, but shouldn't kill your chances.  However, if you look greasy, dirty, unkept, or smell... that's a different story... you basically lose all points there.  IMHO, if you're going to buy clothes anyway, you might as well try to look fashionable (money is not an excuse, thrift shops are all you need if you have dedication).  So I guess yes and no to this one.\n\n4. No lol.  Maybe if anime/game shit is the first thing out of your mouth, or you only talk about niche engineering concepts... but that's generally due to a lack of shared interest or understanding. \n\nMy opinion: I'd chalk it down to focusing more on studies than personal life... and not putting themselves out there enough....  I don't know how bad gender ratios are in engineering courses, but in CS they don't seem terribly disproportionate... so I wouldn't say that's a huge factor... maybe it's a bigger factor in Engineering?"""

b'What grant are you referring to?'
"b'As a fellow American, I think I can give you the straight and narrow on this. It was a concern I had before attending UBC as well. I was very hooked on the question, ""will I get the real college experience""? \n\n\nI grew up in Boulder, CO and went to high school 10 minutes from CU which is, I\'m sure you know, quite the party school. A lot of my friends (the majority) went to CU. I know a real party scene when I see it. I\'ve been to CU frat parties surrounded by thin, blonde, beautiful, sorority girls. People chugging from 3-story beer bongs and doing coke off of future-Ms. USA\'s tits. Holy shit those parties are fun...\n\nI also have lost friends to heroin overdoses and benzo-induced suicides. I\'m not saying this to try and scare you, but it happens. It\'s part of the ""real college experience"", at least at CU.\n\nYou won\'t find this at UBC. The frat parties are ""meh"" compared to US frats (no offence frat guys, you just don\'t have the numbers American frats do). Drug use, while definitely present at UBC (I checked, just to be sure), is minuscule compared to big American colleges. Weekend parties (again, smaller, but present) are fewer and further between. I do HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend checking out the UBC Ski and Board and UBC Surf Clubs though. They throw great parties with some of the most solid, fun loving, best people you\'ll ever meet. The party scene really will be what you make of it. You\'ll hear from Toronto kids that ""Vancouver nightlife sucks"" but in comparison to CU Boulder, Denver, CSU, any other college town I\'ve been to, Vancouver has a good nightlife with a ton of options any night of the week. \n\nWill you meet great people? YES. 100%. This school is huge and teeming with outstanding people.\n\n\nWill you be able to party to your little heart\'s content? YES! But it will be different than the partying your friends are doing at UCSD and Santa Barbra.\n\nWill you get the American College Experience? No, and that\'s good, and I\'ll tell you why. After 5 years here (finally graduating - my last exam is on Friday) I\'ve grown more than I though possible. I\'m an entirely different person with a new take on the world. I know far too many people in the US who stumble out of their 4th or 5th year in a daze - never having found their bearings - finally realizing what it means to be part of a bigger post-grad world. My friends drank more than I did, they did less work, and they were surrounded by a culture that encouraged and enabled ""college life"" for the majority of their tenure. Rarely does someone raise a finger and say, ""wait, why are we doing this for our 4th straight year""?\n\nAt UBC, you will be immersed in a culture that pushes you to dream bigger. This school really is home to movers and shakers - your peers will be people with the potential to shape the world - and you\'ll aspire to be one of them. This University has the ability to bring out the best in you. I truly believe that the average UBC student finishes their degree with a greater global awareness, passion for lifelong learning, and desire to better humanity than the average US Graduate. This isn\'t part of the College Experience for most US students (at least not from what I\'ve seen) and I\'m so glad for it.\n\n\nObligatory Thanks for the Gold and good luck in University!\n\n'"

"b'So having a watch party for watching the beautiful game assumes someone endorses FIFA? \n\nThat would mean watching any professional soccer game on the planet is an endorsement of FIFA. That is because every league on the planet must respect FIFA rules of play ( where other things like fair compensation and proper awarding of points to teams falls under that category). Every professional league in this world is essentially regulated by FIFA.\n\nSo, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit much to say that organizing a watch party for a special event where Canada is taking part in is supporting the corruption of past FIFA leaders.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that it is happening in Qatar, the whole soccer world feels that shame.

"b'Full disclosure I\'m not a member or a frat or sorority, but this isn\'t a discussion, you\'ve just stated your opinion with unsubstantiated claims. \n\n> At the start of my undergrad, I considered Greek life at UBC to be tolerable and almost like a watered-down version of the Greek life I had been exposed to in the United States. However, as I spent more time here, I started to question the value of Greek life to UBC. Greek life is historically (and to an extent still is) an institution that has classist, sexist, racist, homophobic and xenophobic ideologies. Although these issues are most commonly associated with the massive brother and sisterhoods in the United States, the embodiment of these values on campus by frats and sororities can not be overlooked. \n\nWhat are you basing this off of? Besides your own personal feelings, do you have something to submit that would support fraternities/sororities as being anything you described above? To call them racist or xenophobic seems like a far stretch of the imagination when you look at the Greeks on campus. What makes them classist when admission isn\'t based off economic background? Are you saying they\'re sexist because they are segregated by sex? Do you not think there would be outrage from anyone if we started admitting boys into sororities? Lol. \n\n> The undeniable persistence of rape culture in fraternities is probably the strongest argument for the removal of fraternities at UBC.  \n\nIf it\'s undeniable, can you show me an example of ""rape culture"" at UBC? Please, the RCMP would love for you to provide any info that would help in their ongoing investigation into the claims by Dr. Adshade, which so far hasn\'t turned up any evidence at all. Not a single victim, or witness, literally no one. The RCMP can\'t find anything to support her allegations, but instead they have a history of Dr. Adshade filing noise complaints against the frat houses she lives near, and openly criticizing them for not following up on her complaints as she sees fit. She also openly criticized them for ""covering up evidence"" when they reported that no victim or witness has come forward. \n\nThe current media spectacle she has brought to the University, both in the false drugging accusations and in the current Remembrance Day ceremony criticisms (both of which have trended on national news), does nothing but hurt our university.'"

The Ontario Human Rights Commission, for example, in their Policy on Preventing Discrimination Because of Gender Identity and Expression states that gender harassment should include \xe2\x80\x9c Refusing to refer to a person by their self-identified name and proper personal pronoun\xe2\x80\x9d.  **In other words, pronoun misuse may become actionable, though the Human Rights Tribunals and courts.**\n\nOh, and the CBA letter that you linked does not refute Peterson\'s position that one could face legal consequences for refusal to use pronouns.\n\nIf you read the letter carefully, it says that refusal to use pronouns isn\'t a hate crime, which Peterson agrees with. It also says that private citizens will not have their speech infringed upon or compelled, which Peterson also agrees with.\n\nWhy do they say that? Because discrimination laws do not apply to private citizens. \n\nNow, in terms of C-16 and pronouns, what that means is refusal to use someone\'s preferred pronoun would not be considered discrimination - if you are a private citizen.\n\nHowever, if you are in a protected environment like the workplace, or a business, etc. then such refusal would be discrimination.\n\nWhich means, if your co-worker wants their pronoun to be ""xir"" or ""ze"", and you refuse to use those words - that qualifies as discrimination. Which is what Peterson objects to.'"

If it's not on either, go ahead and ask customer service or your airline for assistance\n\nNow if you have to check in your bag, you will do so at you specific airline (Air Canada, West Jet, Flair... etc). I believe international flights and domestic flights have separate check in areas so watch the signs for that. But if you get lost there's usually staff and customer service desks around and if you tell them the airline and your destination they can guide you to the right area. Note, check in lines are ridiculously long rn and it took me around 2.5 - 3 hours to check in a bag, and will probably take longer for those flying out in the next day or so. If you don't need to check in a bag skip this step completely.\n\nNOTE: If possible you should check in for your flight online before coming to the airport. You should then be emailed a copy of your boarding pass. (Or you can usually print these out for free at the airport, some airlines will charge you - flair for example - but the airport's so packed its best to do it online)\n\nWith your boarding pass you can go through security and my best tip is to take out liquids and electronics before getting to the trays, that way you can move a lot quicker and won't have to worry about taking them out. Put your electronics in one tray and the rest of your belongings in another. Go through the body scanners as guided and wait for your stuff at the other end. I would watch for your trays and see if they get pulled aside. If a tray gets pulled aside, you will need to go around the desk and collect the your belongings from staff after they check it. They may open your bags, ask you questions and so on, but don't worry it's usually a quick process. \n\nAfter security you will need to find your gate. Follow the signs, gates are differentiated into 3 letters A, B, and C and each of these have numbers ranging from 1-30 I believe.\nEg. B21 would be under the letter B at gate 21."""

I considered unsubscribing but I thought I was supposed to get important emails from them?\n\nIt would be irresponsible for the university to not increase tuition at a time of maximal inflation vs any of the past 20 years.  It is not as if they are somehow immune from increased costs themselves.  Getting aggressive at a BoG meeting is misguided-- the rules for domestic tuition are laid out by our government.  Domestic students already enjoy the benefit of a highly subsidized education compared to many other countries.\n\nAnother thing is that the university has always been involved in food security programs as part of a interest towards developing the community.  The university is first and foremost an educational institution, not a welfare program.  I see a lot of attitudes that the UBC is somehow failing to meet people's needs or that UBC doesn't care about you.  Well yes, their primary interest in undergrads as a research university is administering a degree program, you get a student number and go from there.  The university is not your parents there to take care of you.  They make decent efforts to provide a whole raft of extra services that you could never expect to get from an employer .\n\nMy last point is that I am a low income student and I get a good deal of funding from my home province, as well as generous bursaries from UBC.  It isn't quite enough to cover all of my living costs but I also have some savings from prior years in the workforce.

They believe Ben is a voice of hatred for his stance on transgenderism/gay, terrorist, and much more. On the other hand, the UBC Free Speech Club believes people have the right to voice their opinions and invited students with dissenting opinions to attend the event to question Ben on his ideas. However, due to Ben being protested and attacked at some instances when speaking at US universities (UC Berkeley), UBC FSC had to get private security and the ticket price was prohibitively expensive for people who wanted to ask questions. (Chan center rental + staff + private security + RCMP standby = $60/ cheapest ticket ).

Please read the full report if you're interested in the issue, I have only read the summary.\n\nFrom that, I think that even if the inequality is purely by choice, having awards for women and girls would incentivize them to go into STEM fields. and tighten the gender gap.\n\nPersonally, from working on group projects, I believe that diversity, including gender-wise, would make a more effective team as you will have really different approaches to solving problems.

"b""I have yet to meet a professor who wishes for the students' downfall.  I know many professors (myself included) who sometimes give objectively hard exams, but that's not the same.  I have given midterms in which the average mark was 50%.  Does that mean that half the class failed?  No -- it means that, for that exam, scoring 25% was roughly the acceptable minimum, scoring 50% was average performance, and scoring 75% was really impressive.  Of course this went together with a policy that overall course marks were scaled.\n\nNow changing the structure of the exam affects the effective learning goals, that is what is being tested.  For example, an exam with time pressure necessarily tests speed (i.e. rewards students who can work faster relative to those who work more slowly), but an exam with fewer problems with more time for each might omit some topics in the course and this rewards students who are good in the selected topics, or students who are good at guessing which topics will be on the exam.  Similarly an exam with easy problems is sensitive for performance at the low end, but pretty random at the top, while scores on an exam with hard problems are not very meaningful at the bottom but very informative about top students.  Exam setting isn't a trivial thing -- a lot of thought goes into the choice and phrasing of each problem and even into small details of the marking scheme.\n\nBottom line: talk to your instructor and ask about the pedagogical reason for the time constraints.  Also ask them about how the exam marks will be incorporated into the final grade (i.e. about scaling).  Ideally they can release some statistics about the exam after it is marked, so you can understand what your mark means relative to your peers."""

Their primary purpose isn't to convince people that rape is wrong. Most people already know that rape is wrong, and those who dont wouldn't be swayed by some posters, as you yourself noted. They have several purposes. For instance, they are meant to educate people on boundaries. In many rape cases, you'll hear the defendant claim that they were not aware that they were committing rape at the time, and thought the other person wanted it. The mindset people have can be influenced through these PSA's. Since you see these posters a lot, you must have seen the tea making one, which essentially boils down to this: Even if your partner asked for tea 5 minutes ago, you have to respect their decision if they change their mind. This can cause some people to become more introspective about whether or not there is consent.\n\nAs for the point of leaving it to the police, you should note that even with combined university and police efforts, this is still an ongoing problem. So if you suggest leaving it to the police, you will have to provide a strong case for how you're going to make up for the gap left by removing the influence of the university.

This program will create a system in which students can build a profile using their career interests, sports career, specialization, and other extra curriculars to get connected with scholarships based on their interests and skills. 

This program will be funded by an optional $10 annual fee to be included in your student fee. Again this fee is completely optional and can be easily opted out of if this is not something that interests you.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a more positive experience concerning mental health support than with them.

In addition if you\xe2\x80\x99re scared of someone finding out the SASC will ask you if/ when/ where they can leave messages etc, just in case someone overhears, they also do video calls so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to physically go anywhere if that a concern.

"Alright, here's the deal. *(TL/DR at bottom)*

I'm in my second year of UBC, and for the same amount of time, I have been living in student housing. Also for that amount of time, I've been absolutely BAFFLED at the rules that UBC Housing has laid out for us. I'm gonna list the ones that I find mind boggling before I propose my plan.

&#x200B;

Rule #1 Section 1.31 of the Winter Contract

Residence rooms and shared units are furnished. **Additional furniture and appliances are not permitted** to be placed in your room or common areas of your accommodation without prior written authorization from the Residence Life Manager 

&#x200B;

Rule #2 Section 3.14 of the Winter Contract

Residents may accommodate overnight guests in their rooms for a **maximum of four (4) nights** in any given month. Residents may be evicted for guests’ stays which exceed this period of time or are a disturbance to the floor, unit/apartment 

&#x200B;

Wonder what my problem with these rules are? No worries, I will explain.

&#x200B;

Rule number one bothers me mostly because HUH? why can't I bring in a new piece of furniture into MY PLACE? I currently have a coffee table in my room, but if my RA found out, I could potentially be EVICTED, just because of that. Unfair, don't you think?

Rule number two is more of a partisan issue in my experience, however, I must ask what the reason for four days is. Why not 3? 5? Why is there a limit at all? What counts as having guests over for a night? Do they need to sleep over? What happens if they're over but they don't sleep? What counts as staying over or just staying late? What time does it cross from being over late to being over for the night? Does it count as a night if they leave at 5 am? What about 6? Where is the line drawn? 

None of this is addressed in the residence contract (I would know).

&#x200B;

So this brings me to my ""plan""

&#x200B;

We need these rules to either be better defined, or abolished completely. If I had my own apartment, I would be able to keep a mf over for as long as I wanted. And I sure as hell would be able to bring my OWN FURNITURE? How does UBC Housing benefit from these almost arbitrary rules?

I had my friend over for four nights and my roommates were so scared that they were gonna get in trouble if he stayed over one more night and were threatening to report me to the Residence Association if he did not ""vacate the premises immediately"" (thanks for the support guys)

Why must we be forced into such an unfair and restricting contract? You wouldn't see this bullshit anywhere else, AND I pay more for student housing than if I DID have my own apartment. (btw I started renting my own apartment to get away from this clown show, so no need to comment ""if you don't like it just leave"")

Don't we come to UBC to be able to become independent adults? Because it sure as hell doesn't feel like it when I'm worried that the big bad RLM is gonna come knocking any day asking me if I have any illegal chairs in my room. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

STUDENTS

We need to demand better from the people we rent from! Otherwise what will future students think when things potentially become even more restricted in the future? This is no way to live. 

&#x200B;

So what can we do?

I don't know about you guys, but I'm calling my RLM. So what if they catch me with a coffee table, or a guest staying for five nights instead of four? We need to call out bullshit rules when we see them, otherwise future students will be worse off in the long run for it. 

&#x200B;

(TL/DR)

There's some bs going on in the residence contracts, and frankly, I'm sick of it. Live in residence? Call your RLM and demand a change, or at the very least, get you and your friends to buy a chair for your kitchen table and see how many of us they can catch!"

"b""Succeeding in university courses depends on many factors.  I always estimate the course load I can handle before the term starts, and I always try to mix up courses that are time consuming with those that are not time consuming. I stayed at UBC for 10 years going to an undergrad student to a PhD student. I took a wide variety of arts and science courses.  To succeed in a course, it is very important to understand the main objectives for each class. Coming to the class is necessary and doing the practice homework questions is a must. For math courses, I do all the practice questions at least twice. Usually I read the notes three or four times, and read the textbook twice. Sometimes, I also find open courses on YouTube. For lower level math courses like calculus, there are sooo many open courses online. The best ones are from MIT's open courseware. I also go to the professor's office hour every week to ask questions. To prepare the final, I usually buy the exam booklet sold by the math club and go over all the questions in the booklet. Doing all these, I usually get an A or A+. \nIt is also useful to figure out the professor's teaching style in each course. Most professors like to test on things they emphasized in class but some do it more than others. If the professor emphasized that coming to class is very important in his/her first lecture, I usually take it as a sign that the prof likes to test what he/she mentions in class. Some professors are picky deadlines and deductions while others are more lenient and flexible. Figuring out this kind of things requires a good amount of EQ. Indeed succeeding in a course depends on both EQ and IQ. \n """

The thing I disliked the most was the hypercompetition and how competency seems to be defined on how much of a success you get on your first shot. When I got more involved I tend to like it more. It's definitely a grass is greener on the other side phenomenon. The school is very big to generalize I think, having a niche helps a bit.

Do you have any data backing up the claim that ""male perspectives and issues"" are being ""neglected""? Why is the gender divide being highlighted in particular, as opposed to say, socio-economic or sexual orientation? Furthermore, while men\'s rights is a valid issue in some respects, it in itself tends to be a calling card to those more concerned with anti-feminism and ironically, gender inequality.

I felt more energetic and could tell something was different, but it ultimately did much more harm than good.  I would regularly have a racing heart, and had to see a cardiologist for issues that, as it turned out, could have likely been a result of Vyvanse.  My anxiety became so bad as a result of the drug that I would vomit all the time- before a difficult class, feeling nervous in stop-go traffic, etc.  Since I felt so awake I would stay up late and sleep in- sometimes missing classes.  In terms of academics, that semester was my worst marks.  I didn't even pass all my classes.\n\nThe thing was, it wasn't until a few months after stopping the prescription that I realized how many things were a result of the drug and what a negative impact it had on me.  It's hard to say 'oh this is my true mental state and this is only a result of medication'- when you're taking it there's no real way to differentiate it.\n\nWhile some more serious health issues were very much a result of my true undiagnosed problem, the Vyvanse also had a number of negative impacts.\n\nI turned out to have a physical disease, where brain & nervous system was one of the things affected.

"b'While I understand that it feels unfair for the average mark to go up by 7% but for your own to stay the same, *it is not the same as rewarding students who originally did not get the question correct*. In fact, most people got 2/3 sub-questions correct, but received 0/2 because of the marking scheme for that question. The average mark isn\xe2\x80\x99t really increasing by 8% because the average which was being displayed on Canvas did not represent people\xe2\x80\x99s actual scores on that question. On average, if most people were supposed to get 1.33/2, that would mean that the average mark should have been 5.8% than what Canvas was saying (so about 64.5%) -- exactly how unfair was it to \xe2\x80\x9craise\xe2\x80\x9d the average to 65%? Yes, it was explicitly stated that you needed to get all components of that question correct to get full marks, but why don\xe2\x80\x99t we talk about brackets now, since so many people feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair? If you accidentally deleted or forgot a bracket and lost 8% of an exam grade, how would you feel? I also believe that this in part is due to the instructors recognizing that the average for the exam was lower than expected, and listening to concerns about the grading of that particular problem. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that they\xe2\x80\x99re fixing it with the lowest amount of effort possible, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the method that gets closest to the result we\xe2\x80\x99re all hoping for, which is for everyone to the mark which they deserved. (Of course, there is always going to be that small group of students who got 0/2 and are now being rewarded with 2/2, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t represent the majority in this situation). Think about this: if this was a written exam where half of the students were given credit but half of them weren\xe2\x80\x99t, and the average mark went up after everyone who didn\xe2\x80\x99t get credit was given their marks back, is it still unfair to those who did have credit for the problem and achieved an above-average grade before the marks were fixed?'"

Then again, it being imperative that you do well in such courses may be an argument, although I had alluded to course reduction for the sake of mental health.\n3. It gives those with very conflicting schedules (such as varsity athletes) the earliest registration times.\n\nThe mental health thing is tricky because it is vaguely defined. How would that work exactly? For the case of varsity athletes having the earliest registration time--it's black and white--the person is either a varsity athlete or not one. And I think it's fair that they have an early registration time when their training and games can be very conflicting.

"b""UBC is literally constantly building up housing. Just in the time that I've been at UBC they've put up Exchange, Saltwater, and now Brock Commons Phase 2 is nearing completion - all multistory, high density housing. And in that time the number of students attending UBC had not changed significantly as far as I know. So UBC has definitely taken some students off the market yet the cost of housing keeps going up. Though I do believe UBC should do what it can to make housing more affordable for students, and it's very likely that it could and should do more, it isn't really the source of the problem. Also, only just over a third of students at UBC are international students. Two thirds are domestic students, and not all of them are from the lower mainland. And even those that are don't all live with their parents. Domestic students have to live somewhere too, but OP only points the finger at international students."""

"b'I cannot speak for the social life at other schools, all I can speak for is my own 3 years of experience here that I have deeply enjoyed. \n\nI will say two things. The first is that UBC is *not* a party school, not by a long shot. The majority of the student body (myself included) is definitely more focused on academics. The most action you\'ll see is Wednesday at The Pit, or the weekends at the Frats or the residences. But the Pit and the Frats can get really greasy, and residence parties get broken up pretty regularly. I wont say that those things aren\'t fun because there are a lot of people who enjoy them, but I don\'t really think they\'re my type of fun.\n\nThe second things I\'ll say is a rough equation. ~40,000 students + ~8,000 beds on campus = campus is deserted after 5pm most days. It\'s just a fact that UBC is a commuter school and this has often been pointed to as a reason for the ""lacking"" social scene. I do feel there\'s bit of a sense on campus that we\'re lacking the community spirit other schools have. But really what can you do when you have such a large student body and so many people who show up for 4 hours for class then head back home for the evening.\n\n""The college experience"" is whatever you set out to make. Getting blackout drunk 6 night a week? Making friends from every continent? Pulling a 1am study session in the Library to keep up your 4.0? I think all of these are possible here. I\'ve chosen to go more towards number 2 and 3, and I have certainly enjoyed myself along the way.'"

"b'I admit, I was worried about this myself. Not only am I a gay student, I am in my 40s, so I am a fair bit older than most students. Before starting at UBC in September of 2016, I had been a student at the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV), in Abbotsford (aboot ~75 km from UBC) for two years. It was a horrible experience. UFV has a small, narrow minded and ridiculously religious student body. In fact, after the Pulse shootings last year, the Pride Collective at UFV tried to hang a pride flag in the Student Union Building, and it was confiscated by the Student Union. I did experience harassment from students\xe2\x80\x94for the first time in my life, and I have been out for 25 years! And when I tried to seek assistance about it from the Human Rights office, I was told that the homophobia at the University of the Fraser Valley was ""systemic"" and could never be changed...and this was in 2015. So believe me, I understand your concerns!\n\nUBC, on the other hand, is MUCH different. When I went in to speak with an arts academic advisor before registering, there were LGBT safe space (or something like that I forget what exactly they said) signs and stickers pretty much  everywhere I looked\xe2\x80\x94windows, walls, bulletin boards, desks. To be honest, I got a little verklempt after the misery I experienced at UFV, because I felt so welcomed. I told the advisor that I met with how nice it was, as a gay student, to see this...and he was absolutely stunned that I would make such a remark...shocked that any university campus in Canada would be anything different than UBC. \n\nUBC is such a diverse community, one that I am so incredibly proud to be a part of. It is certainly far less homophobic than the rest of Vancouver (admittedly, Vancouver, as a city, is not as LGBT friendly/ safe as one may think, so yes, you must be on guard, especially at night) and it is certainly less homophobic than the dreadful bible belt of the Fraser Valley. UBC is a refreshing diverse atmosphere, there are seriously people from everywhere of all walks of life. I admit that I am not the most social or ""out"" person, and I don\'t consider myself a member of the Pride Collective, I don\'t hide the fact that I am gay or that I am married to a man, and I have never ever felt anything but welcome on campus. So fear not, and welcome to UBC!\n'"

"b""Interesting question. I grew up in Seattle and moved back to Canada in 2010 after not having lived there full time since I was a kid. I think, aside from UBC (which is a great school and a bad institution, very much like UW) there are serious advantages to living in Canada over the US- I think that's going to be one of the big deciding factors for you. \n\nThe thing about Seattle is that its regressing at a faster rate for anyone who doesn't work in tech or at Amazon. The transit has gone to hell- what was a decent bus system has turned into a lumbering toy streetcar network and rapid transit takes twice as long to get to the airport. We bitch about Vancouver transit, but it's really pretty damn good when compared to most of the west coast. Our trains are fast, we have a lot of busses and commuters can live in affordable places while maintaining access to central Vancouver. \n\nAll of my friends in Seattle have had to move further out of the city to make ends meet.

Which made me think about my ultimate goals. We all had different upbringings, but if you can afford to spend 4 years FT at UBC, I am assuming that most of you fall in the middle to high-income family bracket, although the occupations of your parents may vary widely.

Then, if you somehow knew that hard work at UBC will give way to a quality of life like that of your parents, and very rarely put you in a wealthier bracket (due to inflation, soaring housing prices, highly inflated and matured stock markets with diminishing returns compared to the 80s, and increased competition from population growth and immigration) are you happy about that?

People don\'t become hardasses. It\'s better imo when I think back on parties before 25 and after.  Also there are plenty of students over 25 that attend block party. Definitely confused why you brought up age.

"b""Dumb post imo. All for UBC putting more effort into addressing the housing issue, but this is a weird way of doing it.\n\nIt's not just international students, out of province/city students can cause problems (although imo as an OOP student we get a little bit of the short end of the stick, as we absolutely need housing in Vancouver, but may not have the housing guarantees a lot of international students may have due to scholarships)\n\nWhile UBC may have some responsibility, I'd say the government has a larger role in it. \n\nFirst off a lot of these issues could be solved with better transit to UBC. A commute from Burnaby wouldn't be all that bad if we had a SkyTrain line to UBC already. \n\nNext UBC accepting too many students in general, especially with the fact that first years are gaurenteed housing if they want it, which creates a bit if a false sense of security. Mind you a lot of this is particularly bad this year due to pandemic HS grade inflation, students who delayed their admission due to lockdown, etc. \n\nUBC also needs more land and money for housing (i.e. some of that property in West point Grey) this issue is twofold because housing is so expensive to build that UBC allows private developers who charge Insane rent to build on campus, which can help in short term but cause problems for students not super wealthy as it takes up prime campus real estate with unaffordable luxury apartments, which is already kind of limited. Hell I'd say at this point finding a way to build closer too or on the endge of Pacific spirt park might not be the worst idea in the world. But that's kinda a last ditch measure as it's kind of important as a conservation and research area. Plus it's just beautiful.\n\nLastly the style of housing needs to change a little i think. Sure full apartments with kitchens and bathrooms etc are wonderful and it's cool that UBC has student housing like that, but that's kind of rare and not the norm for a lot of schools. Upper year Dorm style housing with shared bathrooms, kitchens and lounges, less restrictions on personal cooking items like induction stoves would help a lot.  Students may not like this but the reality is this is how student housing is done nearly everywhere, and is one of the reasons many schools abroad even in places with housing crises usually can house most if not all of the students who want or need it. \n\nThis is because it creates incentive for students with the means to live off campus or in private housing to do so (i.e. those loaded international students you're angry about) as it you can get things student housing can't get you like some privacy, versatility and/or luxury, which naturally lowers demand for student housing.\n\nI.e. it avoids situations like the one at UBC where unless you're absolutely loaded, student housing is just by far the nicest and best deal for housing you can get, and you'd be stupid to not put your name on the list as chances are even if you don't want it you can sublet under the table it to someone who does, As it's basically just a nice apartment for the cheapest rent you can find in a 10km radius\n\nAnyways rant over time to crawl back into the closet I'm renting for 700$ a month.

"b'Regarding the question in the title of your post, I\'ll echo what others have said. Some of this may be slightly outdated (I\'ve been in Canada a while now), but it gives you a sense of the traditional structure and educational path...\n\nEnglish and Welsh secondary schools are much more specialized. Students typically take three or perhaps four subjects in their final two years of school, and have already for instance definitively chosen between Arts and Sciences. They then apply to a specific ""major"" at university (and are offered a place or not on that basis); once at university rarely take classes beyond that major.\n\nNB however that the system in Scotland is different, both at secondary school (where pupils take ""Highers,"" rather than A levels) and at university, where degree courses do take four rather than three years. New Zealand has a similar system, no doubt copied from Scotland. University degree courses in Scotland are somewhat more flexible than in England and Wales, though not as much as in North America (Canada and the US).\n\nPersonally, I\'m a fan of the Scottish system, which avoids the pitfalls of both early specialization (as in England and Wales) and delayed specialization (when students can spend the first few years rather purposelessly, as in the US and Canada).\n\nIn some ways, however, your second question is more interesting: ""why do we need a degree for so many jobs anyways?"" There are many good reasons why expanding access to higher education has been a policy goal across much of the world since World War II. On the whole, it is taken as a good in itself that more people should be able to go to university or college. Before WWII, and even in the 1950s and 1960s (and as late as the 1990s in places like the UK), higher education was very much the domain of the elite.\n\nUnfortunately, in effect expansion has not necessarily meant democratization, rather in many places the emergence of the two (or three or even four) tier system, with the more elite institutions continuing to admit a disproportionately elite student body, while many of the rest have to make do with poorer (in all senses) institutions that have been systematically deprived of public funding and survive on the racket that is student loans.\n\nEmployers, meanwhile, have for the most part given up on internal training, apprenticeships, and the like (for a variety of reasons) and outsourced even professional and trades training to educational institutions. (To give an example: previously, many large companies would have  major management training schemes; now that work is done, on the prospective employees\' dime, at business schools such as Sauder.) This makes economic sense to them. And in as much as the job market is a buyers\' rather than a sellers\' market, employers can also raise the requirements for entry-level jobs, which now in white collar work routinely means requiring a degree of some sort, whether or not it is related to the specific profession.\n\nOf course, all this begs the question as to whether or not universities should be seen primarily as vehicles for training for the job market or instead as, you know, sites of critique and free investigation.'"

"Hi! So basically, I'm not indigenous, but the recent events have motivated me to ask this question again. We did learn about residential schools in high school, but not in the detail that I did when I came to university, and I can only say i was horrified.  In first year someone told me its not my place to volunteer or get involved in indigenous advocacy and charities. This person was not indigenous, but they could definitely still be right. 

Obviously I understand that I shouldn't be the a main speaker at an educational event, nor should I try and police indigenous peoples on how to live their lives a certain way. However I can't help but feel a sense of duty as a ""Canadian"" to get involved and help out in some ways. So to those who are indigenous or educated on this subject, what's your take?

The health regulations are done on a provincial level, so if UBC were to cancel their classes later than say, Western or UofT, it would not be reasonable to blame UBC for being slow. However, it was definitely frustrating that classes were going despite the panic, especially when other universities cancelled lectures earlier.\n\nIf you look at TRU, UVic and UFV their last day of face-to-face classes was on the 13th.

" So I got this message from my Dean....

In early March, [UBC announced](https://broadcastemail.ubc.ca/2021/03/08/increased-on-campus-activity-for-the-2021-22-winter-session-2/) that we are “planning for a return to on-campus activity for Winter Session, Term 1, in September 2021.” This decision was based on the [advice of the Provincial Health Officer](https://covid19.ubc.ca/files/2021/03/1190387-Letter-to-PSI-Presidents-final.pdf). It was made after careful consideration of various factors including the pace of vaccinations in Canada and the importance of in-person learning to the overall experience of students.

We would like to reassure you that health and wellbeing of our UBC community is of paramount importance as we chart our plans for a full return to campus.

**What does this mean for Applied Science Students?**  

\-  You are expected to be on campus (e.g., to attend in-person classes) for September 2021.

\-  Applied Science is planning to offer courses primarily in-person and as such the selection of courses offered fully online will be limited.

\-  If you are unable to come to campus for reasons beyond your control, we’ll do our best to support your degree progress but there will be no guarantee that the courses you need will be available online.

\-  A set of relevant FAQs that include information about housing, health and wellbeing and other services is available at [https://covid19.ubc.ca/information-for-students](https://covid19.ubc.ca/information-for-students).

Our plans for September are subject to the health and safety protocols as defined by the Provincial Health Officer. If there are substantial changes, we will provide you with an update to our plans. For the most up-to-date information from the university about our return to campus, please continue to visit [covid19.ubc.ca](https://covid19.ubc.ca/information-for-students/). Meanwhile, we are working across the campus to provide specific course information in advance of your [registration date](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/registration-dates).

We recognize that this continues to be a challenging and uncertain time, and your wellbeing may be impacted – you’re not alone and we encourage you to access the support resources available to you as a UBC student at [students.ubc.ca/support](https://students.ubc.ca/support).

It kind of sucks how they are not addressing the issue of the fluctuating +1000 cases per day on top of the fact that our university probably has the most international students in Canada. The last paragraph is basically UBC's way of saying ""We are sorry, but not sorry at the same time"".

Journal article link as follows: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349506880\_HIGHER\_RACISM\_THE\_CASE\_OF\_THE\_UNIVERSITY\_OF\_BRITISH\_COLUMBIA\_-\_ON\_THE\_WRONG\_SIDE\_OF\_HISTORY\_BUT\_RIGHT\_SIDE\_OF\_OPTICS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349506880_HIGHER_RACISM_THE_CASE_OF_THE_UNIVERSITY_OF_BRITISH_COLUMBIA_-_ON_THE_WRONG_SIDE_OF_HISTORY_BUT_RIGHT_SIDE_OF_OPTICS)

Please try and remain civil during the discussion as I understand some of the content discussed may be uncomfortable. I'm refraining from sharing my opinion, just really wanted to hear people's thoughts on this from the UBC Reddit community. 

Cheers,"

"b""I'm going to answer this question as if you had said Chinese instead of Asian, because I think that's what many people are too uncomfortable to say, and I doubt that you're asking about Thai and Pakistani students' presence at UBC. \n\nWith that being said, yes, Chinese culture undoubtedly has an influence on UBC's campus. UBC is primarily a Canadian school with strong international linkages/representations, where Chinese influences are the strongest. To paint the simplest picture possible, I would argue that UBC's student body can be loosely divided into three groups; 1) Domestic Canadians + American students; 2) International students excluding Chinese; 3) International Chinese students. There is fairly significant interaction between the first two, though I must admit in my own experience the majority of my close friendships have been with fellow Canadians more than internationals. From what I can discern there is far less interaction between the international Chinese group and the first two, though perhaps others will have had different experiences. \n\n\nI think many people find this threatening or are unwelcome to it, due to A) the language barrier, B) the separation of student bodies, C)the visible wealth of some Chinese students and D) the effect Chinese investment has had on the Vancouver housing market. Despite these perceived detriments to UBC, I think the Chinese student population gives much more to campus culture than many give them credit for, such as:\n\n-  Demographics. I must say, as a non-white (and non-Chinese) Canadian, it has been really refreshing to go to a school where there is much less clearly a white majority. It's also been funny hearing white Canadian friends go through the feeling of being a visible minority. \n\n- Style. International Chinese students, distinct from Canadian-born Chinese students, also often dress very differently from Canadian + other students. It's always nice to see non-Western fashion influences on campus, which while some would call weird, I find really fun and interesting. \n\n- Food. I'm going to cheat a bit and go back on my choice to focus on Chinese influence. There's a really strong representation of Asian cuisine in Vancouver food culture, with pho, sushi and ramen being really popular meals. \n\n- Language. A lot of people really dislike the strong Mandarin presence on campus, especially when some Chinese students speak poor English (and trust me, this does happen). Hearing it so often actually made me much more interested in learning it, and after trying the typical French/Spanish/etc route of meeting my language requirement, instead tried Mandarin and found I absolutely loved it.\n\nI could go on but this post has gotten way longer than I anticipated. In essence, if you keep an open mind, UBC can offer you a distinct opportunity to explore a culture that is not Canadian, and that in itself is valuable.  """

"b'IMO, in situations like this your best bet is to choose the faculty that is harder to transfer into.

"b'I can speak to this as I spent my first year at U of T and transferred back to UBC for my second year. Keep in mind that what I say is probably biased since I was born and raised in Vancouver. Plus, the fact that I\'m studying here at UBC instead of U of T is pretty tell-tale of my personal opinion. \n\nOk, so for me the biggest difference between the two schools academically were class sizes. I went from my first year with the biggest classes of about 1000 students, to the fewest: about 300. Here at UBC, the class sizes rarely exceed 200. This is important because it meant that a lot of time I was spending time talking to TA\'s at U of T and got little to no face time with the professors. The only interactions would be during 2 hour lectures, and TA\'s would do all the marking, evaluating, and further instruction/answering questions. That also reinforces the ""students as merely a number"".\n\nIt also depends on what you plan on studying. U of T is known as ""U of Tears"" and that speaks to the workload and difficulty of the courses there. On the other hand, I myself am studying Psychology at UBC and I find the constant scaling down of grades very frustrating and difficult as well. \n\nWhile at U of T, I also noticed a sense of superiority there. People complained about how much harder they had it compared to other schools (since it\'s ranked number 1 in Canada), and professors often poked fun at lesser schools (Ryerson, York, UNBC). Whether this was a joke or not, it was quite commonplace at U of T. \n\nIn terms of nightlife, I\'m assuming you\'re attending the St. George Campus in Toronto and that\'s smack in the middle of the downtown area. Toronto is known for its nightlife, and being downtown, it\'s going to be super convenient for you. BUT, during first year, everyone is partying and socializing and trying to make friends so I don\'t think there is much of a difference there. One thing to note is that since U of T holds more prestige or whatever, I find that there are a lot more people from diverse backgrounds to attend the school. I\'m assuming you\'ll be living on residence, so you\'ll get a chance to meet a fair amount of people from all over the world. \n\nThe first year residences are vastly different for UBC and U of T as well. UBC only has two first year residences (Vanier and Totem), so everyone around you will be in their first year. At U of T, residences are split into ""colleges"", and then within the colleges are more specific buildings for first years. The latter is probably more integrative as you can interact with upper year students during events and whatnot. Res life varies across colleges, some are more known for partying while others are known for more studious kids. \n\nThat\'s all I can think of for now, OP. Hope this wasn\'t too long, message me if you have questions! \n\nEDIT: the word I was looking for is ELITIST, not superiority. There was an elitist vibe at U of T '"
"There are tons of universities trying to make vaccinations mandatory for their students or staff, if not, both. 

Many regard it as a “good measure” and labeled those who rejected or even being dismissive towards such scheme as “anti-vaxxers”

But, isn’t forcing the majority of its students or staffs to vaccinate a bit radical, if not, unethical? For, not only the vaccines are only approved by the FDA under emergency, we are also forcing them to take  a risk (a risk which could directly result in one’s death or other long term untreatable medical conditions, no matter how small the actual risk really are)

I, myself, is not a anti vaxxers for I have had vaccines countless of time throughout my entire life. 

But, I think the case is a bit different for COVID-19 vaccines. For most COVID-19 vaccines including the BioNTech, uses the mRNA technology which is a relatively new technology unlike past vaccines which are inactivated vaccines. The LONG TERM side effects have not yet be known, obviously, as it is only developed in 2020. 

Another point worth mentioning is the intrinsic difference between mandating the public to inject vaccines and mandating them to wear a mask at all time/ making the public to abide with social distancing rules. The latter would pose no risk to the individual (unless people suffocated and died because of wearing a mask). If this is not the case, people preferences (mask-lover or not) should be overridden in favor of public health for such policy can create the greatest utility (i.e. most pleasure and least suffering) as the pandemic is contained and less people are infected/ affected by it.

The prior (mandatory vaccination) is different. Those who injected obviously have less chance of being infected or infected others. However, they alone bear the risk (once again, no matter how small it is) of getting serious/ life-threatening side effects. Making vaccines mandatory would mean forcing them to make a wager on themselves in favor of others which can hardly be ethical.

An analogy can be made here: A doctor may think the best treatment for a cancer patient is a surgery as his/her cancer is at early stages and that there is 99% chance of the surgery succeeding and a only 1% chance of him/ her being more ill than before. The choice still lies on the patient for the doctor cannot choose on behalf of the patient. It is a foundational principle of medical ethics that consent must be given for any procedure


TLDR: I don’t think making vaccines mandatory is ethical. However, I do think it should be encouraged by giving incentives to those who choose to get vaccinated. For example, shortening their quarantine duration or required those who refused to vaccinate to conduct regular tests. 

As a philosophy major, I welcome any counter arguments. But please don’t use Ad Hominem or call me a anti-vaxxer becoz I am rly not one:) 

If you’ve read through all of it, Thank you!

"b""You're not looking in the right places. Plenty of folks online from ubc and elsewhere that appreciate the field of cs and seng."""
"b""I too went through a similar phase where I thought walking alone/being alone in general was equivalent of being a loser. But after a lot of soul searching, I genuinely prefer being alone than being with other people, but that's just me, might not apply to you. Just putting it out there. While people may think of me being a loser for that, I genuinely don't care for that anymore because I like being alone. \n\nAs for the matter of having a pathetic life, well, what you do after work is entirely up to you. You could do some calisthenics at home to get enough strength that makes you comfortable to go to the gym again. This is what i did for a year, on and off, to prepare myself for the next summer break so i could go to the gym and not embarrass myself. Also, I didn't attempt to deadlift or squat until a month into the summer of going to the gym because i was too scared. Once i got over that and i did my first deadlift/squat, it was quite a refreshing feeling to be in uncharted territories. BTW, I went to the gym alone and no one gives a fuck about what other people are doing at the gym, everyone is there for themselves (Well, some are there just to talk to their friends). \n\nAnd for finding a significant other, I have no tip on that because i have no experience in that field. But i do know, a beta-male and alpha-male have their own communities. You just haven't found the right group within your community that fit you. And if you find a group, the next challenge is how to become part of them. That's the real struggle. And the answer is..... Simply start a conversation with them REGULARLY about some of the common hobbies/interests you may have. You may think they look at you strangely at first, but i would too if someone randomly started talking to me as well. That's why i say talk to them REGULARLY and make sure you to introduce yourself properly. (Hung out with a group that didn't even know my name until i wrote it down in a group project). But you may not be as lucky as me and find a group at school. That's alright. That's why people pursue hobbies, to meet new people.\n\nWith that said, do as you wish with that I said and good luck!\n"""

"b'Malevolence exists in this world. It truly does and there is nothing anybody can do about it. I dislike using the term ""we"" in situations like these because there will always be amazing, kind hearted, altruistic people who will go above and beyond to make you feel heard. On the other hand, there will be uncaring, stone cold, and maybe even malevolent people who will surely increase the amount of suffering the victim experiences. In the middle, there will be people who neither care or don\'t care very much. Everybody is different, with varying degrees of the personality trait agreeableness (this trait decides if you are more empathetic or more cold). It\'s not possible to restructure society such that ""we"" are all high in trait agreeableness - you would have to get down to the cellular level and change the genes that are responsible for that particular personality trait. This is why no amount of ""antibullying education"" ever works in elementary school and high school. How can it, when some people actually derive pleasure from hurting others! The same logic applies to sexual assault awareness. You\'re never going to get 100% your desired outcome (probably nothing even close to that). \n\nThe solution? My opinion is that, on an individual level one should look for people who belong to the caring, loving group (of course easier said than done), all the while being wary that one may run into a member of the disagreeable trait group while doing so. If one runs into a member of the disagreeable group, one can stand strong and say what they believe while accepting that their words may very well be falling on deaf ears. In short, treating this problem as a matter of individual responsibility (ie: taking it upon oneself to find a good support group of friends/health professionals) would be much more conducive to good mental health than spending alot of time thinking about why the rapist and his or her friends, or just people in general don\'t understand the victim\'s feelings - they simply won\'t.\n\nI hope I was able to provide a valid and maybe even helpful point of view!

"b""1. No. UBC has a number of similar services it offers. Regardless of whether or not they do a good job, adding one more is [just going to make everything worse](https://xkcd.com/927/). \n2. God, no. Group work is terrible enough with people you sorta know who all want to get a decent grade, too. Students who want experience working on projects already have a lot of avenues, and anyone who isn't motivated enough to *look* for a project wouldn't be a good team member, anyway. \n\nAdding folks who aren't in a class to class projects is a terrible idea, too. Let's say that A, B, and C are in a course, and want to make a website for a project. They write the content, and get D to design and implement the site. D is not in the class. Everyone else turns in a non-website assignment. You're the professor. What do you do? \n\n* Extra credit for the fact that it's set up as a website is a bad idea, because it creates an unlevel playing field - people who can find someone to create a website (or, worse, pay someone) get better grades. \n* Saying 'okay, we'll act like it's just an essay' creates headaches for everyone because assignment marking is meant to be standardized. If there's more than one marker for an assignment, the markers all need to be calibrated - they get given the same papers, mark them, they're told what grade the professor thinks it should have gotten, and then they discuss how they deviated from the standard. Now, the professor needs to find a bunch of websites that they can pre-emptively mark for the sake of calibration\n\nStudents who want to do extracurricular things join clubs, teams, volunteer for other organizations, work with their professors, etc. etc. \n\nEven *worse*, when was the last time that UBC built a service that didn't totally suck for at least two years post-launch? \n\n> Just imagine if you have a great product design or project idea but you don't have the necessary skills (coding, design, marketing) to make it happen and don't have any friends or connections that can help you. You would most likely drop the idea and pursue something less ambitious. It's happen to me many, many times.\n\nWith respect, if you didn't have the drive to either find someone or learn the skills yourself, either the idea wasn't that great to begin with, or you weren't enthusiastic enough to carry it out even if you had the skills. *Nobody* ever has all of the technical skills they need, if a project is nontrivial. The point of technical projects (engineering/software over here) is that you grow. You don't grow doing what you already know. Folks generally go into hackathons with a vague idea of what they want, and maybe some knowledge of the tools they want to use, but they're not masters, or even really journeymen. They're enthusiastic. \n\nYour initial motivation for this was based on the case of a course assignment requiring skills you don't have. If anyone has this happen to them, **you need to talk to your professor**. You either got into the course but don't have the necessary background, you're being insufficiently supported by the teaching staff, or they expect you to pick the skills you need up for yourself but that message wasn't communicated for some reason."""

"Hey, that rhymes!

Anyways, when I first came to UBC (as an official student), I expected more open socialization. After all, we've matured far beyond cringeworthy high school cliques.

But...

Actually, let's start with an apology: That are-you-okay-you-sound-like-you're-choking-on-a-sword ""*OhhHhHHhhHh*"" sound was not meant to be rude. It was just an involuntary reaction because, well, no one has ever walked up to me and said something so baffling in my life. Or maybe I practised my French R's too much in high school.

Ahem. Let me clear my throat. It is a difficult phrase, yes? It was something like this:

""Hey, you have really cool hair.""

I know what you're all thinking, everyone. I said, ""Thank you.""

No. No. *No.*

""*OhHHhHHhH*.""

For emphasis, let's repeat that.

""*OhHhHhhHHhhhhHHh#e8grbn2teijgiowr45g.*""

As you can see (or hear), I was quite ex*quis*itely articulate.

To clarify: I was not trying to be rude when I waited an indefinite amount of time to expel the following:

""Uh... Erm... Urgh... Tha-anks.""

It was at this point—well, after too long of a period of awkward eye contact—that you suddenly exited the room with the strange magic extroverts expel like unicorns that ate too many rainbows.

""Sure!"" you exclaimed. (Or some similar phrase.)

I soon reported this to the Official Introvert's Emergency Laugh-at-Me Centre, otherwise known as my friend who sits next to me in CHEM 121. We laughed about this until the lecture began. Thou art famous now, at least amongst a national population of two.

""*OhHhhHHhHH.*""

I didn't react like that on purpose. I promise! You just weirded me out. A lot. I hope *that* doesn't come across as rude. It was just so, *so* random.

After this near-death experience, I proceeded to my seat—this is before the portable OIELMC arrived—and pulled out my phone, checking my hair for quantum chemical anomalies. Alas, some hair was sticking out slightly, but you could only see it if you looked for it.

I proceeded to think about this life-threatening incident on the bus, SkyTrain, and other bus home. (It's an hour to reach where I live.) This impressed upon me many philosophical questions, such as the following:

* Am I actually bald? Have I been hallucinating my entire life?
* What is hair?
* Do unicorns really eat rainbows?

(If anyone has answers to these questions, I'm sure UBC would be more than happy to grant you a PhD in Philosophy.)

But perhaps the strangest part of the whole situation is this: My hair doesn't usually look like this. I've just been too lazy to cut it.

Sincerely,

A random first-year

""*OhHhHHhhHHh.*"""

I'm choosing UBC primarily because of cost. Moreover, actually getting into the CS major at UW is pretty DAMN tough because the acceptance rate is 30%. I would suggest that if you are admitted as a pre-major at UW you should consider this. The rate might not be as bad as CS though. \n\nAnd of course the co-op program.

"Hi All, 

To start off, I know it was very stupid of me to use Chegg and copy off the equation verbatim. I would list of my excuses but nothing I can say will put my situation in a better light. Anyway, my professor's instruction for the exam is:

*""open book/open notes/internet allowed exam. You may not work with anyone else. Collaborating with anyone else on the exam will result in a report of academic misconduct.""* 

We have had 2 classes since the he posted the exam results and feedback and he has not mentioned anything about the midterm/anything wrong in general. I had recently checked the feedback for the midterm and one of my feedback for one question (that I had copied off Chegg, I hate myself) is that, it was the answer for one of his other class (who took their exam a day before our class). As you can see, its been 4 days since the feedback has been posted and we have had 2 classes already without him mentioning it in class or calling a person out.

Since reading that feedback, I've had bad anxiety issues that leads to severe concentration issues and emotional breakdowns. I have not received any emails from my professor or any emails from the school about it. Am I thinking too much into it? Should I fess up? 

Thank you for anyone who reply, I can understand if you call me out because I really deserve it."

Then there's also the fact that they have had their working hour cap lifted and literally every grocery store and pharmacy is hiring right now. Unlike local students who have to worry about bringing this virus home to their older parents or grandparents - these international students don't have to worry about that. There's no excuse for not going out and getting one of those jobs. I really don't understand this entitled attitude towards a foreign government. The fact that they are included in CERB already is way more than most other governments in the world would do and yet all I hear is about how these mythical poverty stricken international students who were rich enough to pay all their expenses without working the past 12 months suddenly can't do that anymore and need a foreign government to give them cash. There's also the issue that international students might not even be in Canada at the moment - which is extremely problematic when handing out cash payments. I don't think any Canadian would like the idea of our government giving cash payments to people outside of Canada so they can stimulate their own countries economy and not ours."""

"b""I'm an intl student who did the IB in the Philippines though I'm not from there. I picked UofT and am returning this fall \xe2\x80\x94 and I agree with most of what's already been said. UofT St George (the other campuses are barely talked about since they represent corporate greed and expansion rather than actual merit) is very prestigious. Penicillin was discovered there, blah blah, some prime ministers went there, Malcolm Gladwell went to Trin, etc. There is a lot of elitism that I personally don't like, but the university is considered the best in Canada and among the best in North America, so I guess that's what comes with a high ranking. \n\nWhen I first landed up in Canada I was nervous, like you are, but Toronto is oustandingly diverse in its ethnic makeup so you'll be sure to find people of similar backgrounds \xe2\x80\x94 I have a similar IB expat background, for example! A lot of immigrants come through Toronto and within a year you'll find a lot of your friends acquiring Canadian citizenship if they've lived there long enough. But more than people of your own background you'll meet people completely different, who've lived in Ontario their whole lives or who moved there when young. But there is a sizeable Brazilian community in case you miss your home culture \xe2\x80\x94 trust me, I did, to my surprise. \n\nUofT's location is also smack downtown which is fantastic if you're a big city bird, which I assume you are since you live in Hong Kong. I understand that UBC's campus is far off from Vancouver's downtown area which I suppose can be limiting in terms of big-city experience. \n\nOverall my time at UofT has so far been positive. I think most of the professors are fantastic and very passionate, and I've changed a lot since first year and met some great people. That said you should pick where you are most comfortable. Judging by your profile and background, I'd recommend UofT, but again that's up to you. The main downsides are that it can be isolating, there is poor communication between administrators and students, and it's freezing cold in the winter. But the admin-students conflict can be found anywhere. It's a sign of the times; we're conditioned to commodify ourselves to the corporates ... Stick to your guns and you'll be all right.  \n\nWhy don't you post or browse the UofT subreddit? It's more active than this one and you'll hear a lot more perspectives, some more negative than mine.

"b'Full disclosure: I\xe2\x80\x99m also an atheist. I had a really negative experience coming up in church and Christian schools, which ultimately led to having a deep hatred towards religion and people of faith for a long time. Thankfully, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to largely move past those negative feelings and have actually come to appreciate certain aspects of religion. \n\nOne is that I do think having some sort of belief/sense of purpose and, especially, a sense of community is really important for people, so it\xe2\x80\x99s really nice to see someone stepping up to let young people know there\xe2\x80\x99s a place for them in your community no matter how they identify themselves. I really commend you for that. \n\nGiven my beliefs, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, one of the positive experiences I remember having in youth services was when we would get everyone together to do little community projects. Sometimes that would be putting on a lunch for the less fortunate or organizing a winter coat drive for kids of struggling families. \n\nOne of the most historically inspiring things about Christianity was the message of being kind and generous, and helping those in need, but I think the association between the church and these values has largely become lost to the general public in recent years. \n\nAs young people, I think that so often we feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot we can do to create positive change in the world, but it can be really empowering to come together and do something that helps others, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s just something small. To the folks on the receiving end, it can mean the world to them that someone would reach out and lend a helping hand during a time when they\xe2\x80\x99re in need.

"b""I asked the same question when I was in first year, and I got so many conflicting answers that I've concluded that this question is dumb (not to be harsh).\n\nAn Bachelor of Arts degree has no linear career path. BA Econ grads don't go onto become institutional economists. BA Political Science grads don't go onto become Political Scientists. BA Philosophy grads definitely don't become professional philosophers.\n\nIt's scary doing a degree and not knowing where you'll end up. If you are consistently worried about this, I don't think it's a bad idea to consider another educational path with a linear career trajectory, like Law, CS or Skilled Trades. But Arts students are incredibly diverse, and the faculty consists of people who barely scraped by and got into UBC with no willpower, to incredibly talented students overcoming adversity on a daily basis.\n\nI worried a lot that with an Arts degree, I'd end up unemployed or underemployed. My gut reaction at the time wasn't to wait until the end and see if that was true, I took a year off to work casual contractor roles in the public sector, and spent another year doing co-op/internships. The consequence of that is that I never took a single summer off (my longest vacation ever since starting UBC was 3 weeks) or managed to fit Go Global into my degree (things that I think many people would regret, and I do too).\n\nWhen I graduated, with a mix of applications and networking, I landed about ~13 job offers (excluding offers for 4-month or casual employment contracts, which are handed out like candy during our current major labour shortage). This isn't meant to be a flex, I'm saying that your opportunities with an Arts degree are ultimately very broad. This is in spite of me being rejected from every single consulting practice and think tank in my specialization. The lowest offer I received was a 1-year non-renewable contract in Toronto for 44k, where I had to pay for my own health/dental benefits. The highest offer was a 1-year renewable contract in Vancouver for 75k (total comp $82.5k when you include retirement match). I took a permanent offer very close to the upper band. \n\nI can provide proof of this to the mods, but despite what the STEM circlejerk on this subreddit proclaims, an Arts degree obviously doesn't condemn you to poverty. Right as I was graduating, this subreddit upvoted a post to the moon, [claiming to offer honest advice from a hiring manager that doing an Arts degree is the most pointless investment possible.](https://redd.it/mkmjvw) Although the stigma associated with an Arts degree on this subreddit has definitely improved over the years I was here (as its grown much more diverse), I still regularly see students making broad definitive statements about the outcomes of Arts grads when they've still yet to hold down a real job.\n\nThe fact that you have a degree ultimately means very little. It can dictate an expected earnings band or general career path for sure (I don't think the average Arts grad is generally going to make 100k right out of school, but that might be very reasonable for a CS grad willing to relocate). It's not going to have as much of an impact on getting you a job on its own.\n\nPeople give advice with such confidence on this subreddit when it often tends to be wrong or not applicable. This depends a lot more on your work ethic, your advantages, your background, and your skillsets, than it ultimately ties back to whatever you chose to study (obvious caveats excluded - a BA Econ degree won't let you practice medicine)."""

"b'First of all: congrats on starting at UBC, and starting a really big international adventure! This is an exciting time, although I can understand how you have concerns about different cultural attitudes and staying true to yourself. \n\nFor your concern about avoiding marijuana: In general, there are rules to not smoke (tobacco or marijuana) in or near the entrances of buildings. Sometimes people are rude and do it anyway, but it\xe2\x80\x99s rare. I\xe2\x80\x99d say you are 99.999% guaranteed to never experience someone smoking in class, the library, cafeterias, or the areas immediately surrounding these buildings. As someone mentioned, some folks feel entitled to break the rules in dorms, in which case you report this to your RA.\n\nIf you go to parks or beaches you may pass people who are smoking marijuana, but in my experience they keep to themselves, and you can easily walk by and find a place where you will be comfortable. \n\nOn campus I\xe2\x80\x99ve passed people smoking marijuana outside in the open areas, but again they tend to sit at a distance from the main walking avenues and in general just want to do their own thing and not be bothered. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never, ever had anyone approach me to offer or solicit drugs of any kind. \n\nAs you meet new people, you might encounter some folks who will invite you to hang out and smoke (or drink, or stay out too late instead of studying). Just be polite and say \xe2\x80\x9cno thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather do something like ...\xe2\x80\x9d Most people will respect your feelings, and if they don\xe2\x80\x99t then they\xe2\x80\x99ve made your life easy by clearly showing they are not the type of people to be good friends. \n\nThere are so many clubs and activity groups on campus - if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to make new friends, try out some of the organized clubs. You\xe2\x80\x99ll meet people with a common interest, and any sort of risky behaviour is not going to be encouraged.  \n\nEnd summary: even though marijuana is legal here, it\xe2\x80\x99s easily avoided. No one should pressure you to do ANYTHING you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. If they do, seek out guidance from an RA, the UBC counselling services or Ombudsman, or even talk to a trusted professor or TA about resources on campus. Keep talking to people until you feel like your concerns have been resolved. \n\nI hope this helps give some perspective! Welcome to UBC & Vancouver! It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful place and I hope you have a great first year \xf0\x9f\x92\x99\n\nEdit: based on OP\'s comment history, this seems like someone who comes from a culture where the penalties for using or being associated with marijuana may be far harsher than what anyone in North America has experienced. They also seem very concerned for doing things ""right,"" and like they may not have the experience to make assumptions we (North Americans) take for granted. Have a great day~'"

"Hi everyone! Like the title says :) I'm currently looking for Christian friends at UBC. As a Christian myself, I've actually found it pretty hard to find friends of my same faith; not that I mind having friends that aren't Christian, it just would be nice to have people in my life who share the same faith as me. I joined a bible study, but no other students showed up so it just became a one on one session with the leader. I also unfortunately work on Sundays so it has been hard for me to attend church irl and meet people there. So I thought I'd put it out here on Reddit and see if anyone here wants to be friends! Feel free to shoot me a DM or comment below :)

EDIT: I am aware of the clubs on campus! Most of them run at times when I’m busy (I have a really weird class schedule because of my late registration time) which is why I reached out here :) thank you for that as a suggestion though!"
"b'What was your opinion about, why don\'t you mention it on your reddit post? I feel like you didn\'t say it on purpose. There is a difference between respectfully talking about different opinions and spouting nazi or kkk bs. You should be able to express your different opinion, but respectfully without degrading other. You don\'t have to be respectfull of others opinion, that\'s why it\'s okay to critic different idea or ridiculize different idea. By exemple the criticism of religion, no matter wich one, even if you only dislike or hate one, is okay, you don\'t have to respect others ideologies, you have the right to think that some ideologies are better or worse. However, you have to be respectfull of the person, that\'s why it\'s not okay to degrade them for biological or innerent aspect of their person like their ethnicity or their sexuality. Racist and homophobic ""opinion"" cannot by definition be respectfull. Often (not always), when people are saying that they can\'t share their ideas anymore in University, they mean that they can\'t degrade and humiliate in public other students in their humanity about innerent aspect of their person.'"

"b""What you say makes sense if you accept the neoliberal premise that UBC is a corporate entity that can only balance its budget by raising funding from its consumers. It is not; it is a public institution that serves to provide education under the foundational Canadian belief that education is a human right, as enshrined in the respective provincial educational acts across this nation. The relationship between student and university, in other words, cannot simply be reduced to market relations.\n\nYou quote the 2022 budget that cites near parity between provincial funding and tuition as revenue sources, but you neglect to mention that *this* is in itself a historical low that proves the increasing neoliberalisation of the university. [In 1977 provincial funding constituted 300% of what tuition contributed to the university's revenue, with the majority of UBC's funding at 7.5 million, with tuition contributing 2.5 million](https://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/pdfs/ubcreports/UBC_Reports_1977_04_13.pdf). That figure had [dropped to 162% by 2013](https://bog2.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2013/03/4.1a_2013.04_Tuition-Fees.pdf), and 2022's figure of provincial funding contributing [83% of what tuition brings in to UBC](https://finance.ubc.ca/sites/finserv.ubc.ca/files/budgeting-reports/2022_23_UBCBudgetReport.pdf) is incredibly alarming.\n\nYou are right that the AMS and CUPE 2278 led protests are not the immediate solution to this problem. But they are the first step towards the problem. The issue clearly lies at the provincial level, and more needs to be done to put pressure on the government to reverse this trend. The idea that tuition fees can be equally extracted from all students and redistributed towards certain important programs, however, is a taxation paradigm. UBC is *not* a sovereign government, because students under this unequal compact do not have the right to effect changes in the decision making process, as yesterday's BoG meeting clearly showed. If redistribution of capital is to happen, it needs to occur at the provincial level, where domestic students are able to elect representatives that are empowered through the democratic process to make such redistribution decisions. And international students? Well, they're fucked out of representation either way.\n\nAll this is to say that what you've observed is right if you take only a narrow lens to the demands of 2022, but a greater context for where we are and how we got here is crucial. There are long ideological shifts and battles that have been happening for decades in this country and province which we need to be aware of. Use that education that you're paying so much for. Think critically. Fight back."""

"b""Parts of upper level computer science are a lot like math, particularly discrete math: combinatorics, graph theory, etc. In particular, we create formal mathematical models, and prove theorems about those models.\n\nIn particular, the algorithms, CS theory, and Programming Languages are all very mathematical. Someone working in these fields is primarily creating formal models and proving theorems about them, rather than writing code creating new products.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Theory of Computation and Complexity Theory model problems as sets of finite sequences and algorithms as tuples containing sets and functions.\n* Algorithm researchers will prove theorems about the structures their algorithms operate on, and prove that their algorithms are correct\n* Programming Language researchers use relations to model the behavior of programs (with the semantics of the language), as well as what constitutes a valid program (type systems). This information can be used to construct and prove correct compilers, translators, or optimizations. Additionally, the [Curry-Howard Correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) means PL research is heavily tied to the logic and the foundations of mathematics. \n* Some PL theory uses category theory to model semantics and types of languages. Lattices and partial orders come up a bunch in PL too.\n\n\nInduction is ubiquitous throughout CS, and is the basis for most of our proofs.\n\nEven in the less theoretical fields of CS, like systems, software engineering, etc. an understanding of discrete structures and logic is necessary to know that the things you're building are correct, even if formal proofs aren't always used.\n\nThere are also a large number of areas of CS that draw heavily from existing math:\n\n* AI/Machine Learning uses stats, vector calculus and linear algebra\n* Graphics draws heavily from physics (mechanics) and numerical analysis, as well as 3d geometry\n"""

"First year student here. I just did a midterm for one of my classes, APSC160, and a quiz in a chem class. For the chem class we had 20 minutes to write the quiz… I would say 99% of the class didn’t finish. 

Had my midterm for APSC 160, and I couldn’t even finish writing the code for the last question, and that was worth a third of the midterm. The test was open book and take home you don’t even have time to open your book. I would rather do it in class and closed book and get more time.

But it's going to be difficult to ask this question authentically because this is such a minor thing: it's maybe #75 on the Big List of Things That Affect Your University Experience. \n\nAlso, referring to UBC as an 'asian university' is offensive right out of the gate.  We're a Canadian university, last time I checked.  Even if you're referring to the population, I don't think that individuals of Asian descent form a supermajority, even if they are the largest single group.  International students are outnumbered for sure.  """

Make sure you sleep and eat well, stay hydrated, take your vitamins.

"To the Students who got 100% (or above 90%) on the COMM 205/ COMM 294 Final Exams... OR got above 90% as a Final Grade....

I was so frickin confident going into the COMM 205 and 294 final exams. I spent around a week studying for both of these exams as I really wanted to get A+s in the classes. However, after hours and hours of studying I barely hit 80% in both of these final exams with a final grade of 89% in each of these classes.

&#x200B;

I've come to the realization that:

I'm just not doing something right. I'm not studying the way students who get A+s study. I'm screwing myself over .

&#x200B;

Either way, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being beaten by my peers. Some people may read this and think I'm overreacting (or fishing for compliments) for getting 89% as final grades, but this is really pathetic when you consider how hard I tried this past year. I studied for both of these classes like crazy. I didn't leave my house more than 5 times the entire semester. 5 times the entire semester! I kept up with the COMM 205 ICE exercises all throughout the semester (getting perfect on the ICE, iclickers, and assignments).

With all the hours I spent studying, all I got was 80% on both final exams and a 89% final grade in both classes, and no matter how many people say this is a ""good"" score- in reality its pathetic when you've spent so much time studying. Yes, these would be good scores if I had not spent every day of the semester studying for these courses. They would be good scores if I had maintained a social life and gotten exercise. But the truth is, I don't care about these other things.

2 students got 100% (and many more got above 90%) on the COMM 205 final exam.

A bunch of students got a final grade above 90% in COMM 294.

1 UBC student got accepted to Stanford last year as a transfer after failing her first math midterm.

1 Sauder BUCS student got into MIT for grad school last year.

To these students, what am I doing wrong? Why can't I frickin hit 90s easily after spending that much time and effort? I'm sick of being an idiot. Elon Musk spent his college days arguing with professors that his 98% was really 100%, Mark Zuckerburg got 100% in all of his classes at Phillips Exeter Academy. I don't care if comparing yourself to others is unhealthy- I want to develop the habits and skills of successful people, and at the very least, that means getting A+s when you put in all that effort."

"b'First I need to say that I disagree with your assessment that MRA and MGTOW are not predominantly anti-feminist and anti-women,  [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/df3xqc/good_choice/) is on the front page of /r/MGTOW today, and the top post of all time on /r/MensRights is about trolling /r/Feminism. In my view the movement is more focused on preserving traditional masculine identity and defending it from criticism then from actually progressing for the good of men. Many refuse to acknowledge that the traditional masculine identity is toxic and *bad for men*. (alpha beta dichotomy, boys will be boys, men don\'t cry etc...) Instead they commonly reduce all critique to feminist propaganda. MRA is not an umbrella term for everyone concerned with men\'s problems and you can criticize them without downplaying the importance of men\'s issues. \n\nFortunately there are alternatives! I would point you to the [Men\'s liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_liberation_movement) movement (/r/MensLib). The sub-reddit describes itself as ""a community to explore and address men\'s issues in a positive and solutions-focused way."" They are explicitly an [ally](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/wiki/meta/profeminist) of the feminist movement, and thus are able to adopt ideas developed in the feminist movement to understand how to reconstruct (or deconstruct) the male identity *for the good of men*. \n\nAs a man I myself struggled to find a men\'s focused movement that aligned with my world view and values. I would encourage you to check the men\'s liberation movement out. Because it seems to me that you are not an anti-feminist nor anti-women, it seems that you are concerned with the societal problems that men face, and are interested in real solutions to them. \n\n(I also disagree with your assessment that being anti-feminist does not make you anti-women, but that may be a discussion for another time.)'"

"Okay guys.. hear me out

Remember when there were few posts about lecture recordings staying even after the pandemic?

1. **For big lectures like 50+ people,** we have lectures that students can attend in-person, and also provide the option of lecture recordings (or live streams). Students who aren't vaccinated, or immunocompromised can watch/participate in the comfort of their homes until they're vaccinated. It will only be 10 or 15 students on the first few lectures (with social distancing) and it will gradually increase (with social distancing) as we all get vaccinated. 
2. **For labs which require physical equipment,** we can have in-person labs. Chemistry currently has small in-person labs, which they can ramp up by fall.
3. **For labs/tutorials/discussions not requiring physical equipment,** we can have parallel implementation. So we have a section of in-person labs/tutorials/discussions, and the online version running as well. As long as the delivery is smooth, there wouldn't be a difference in terms of content between online and in-person.
4. **For lectures with 30 to 49 students,** we can either have zoom classes or in-person with social distancing depending on the ability to accommodate the appropriate spaces.
5. **For lectures with less than 30 students,** it can be in-person with social distancing.
6. **Office hours can still run online.**

**All of the above assumes that in-person classes still follow social distancing with masks.** 

Of course, setting up professional lecture recording cameras, microphones, software, etc would come with a lot of costs. But clearly the benefits outweighs it, as on-campus businesses like residence, food services can run properly and make $$. And this recording infrastructure will stay to serve for future years after the pandemic. Other European countries have this infrastructure and there's not much reason why UBC shouldn't. 

Again you might say ""it's not feasible"" but other universities have been doing it. It's more work for higher up executives, and... as we've seen, UBC execs are quite lazy for new initiatives.. There are 129 classrooms that have 50+ capacity. Get those cameras/microphones up, hire more UBC IT Audiovisual staff for support. It's doable."

"I remember at the beginning of the semester everyone at UBC was screaming for in-person classes. During that time there was a scare concerning the Delta variant yet students demanded in-person classes because of their faith in vaccination. In rare cases, we saw Delta infecting the vaccinated but only with mild symptoms. 

 The current resurgence of Covid in many provinces is still due to Delta variant (as the dominating variant), nothing has changed except a new variant (Omicron) popping up on the side as the non-dominant variant. Even with Omicron, no data suggests more than an above-average hospitalization rate after vaccinations. So why are people now switching their opinions? You got what you wanted...you can't demand in-person school and not expect in-person testing!

I never wanted in-person school but it's weird watching y'all cry during finals and making non-evidential justifications for online finals. Learn to live with the consequences of your demands/decision. We all knew before starting the semesters that more variants popping up was not a surprise.

Assuming there are 55k fee-paying students at UBC, this would generate $165,000 making these 4 teams among the best funded in the entire country. \n\nWhat's arrogant about this is that they have the galls to ask for $3 on top of our already significant tuition burden because they couldn't be bothered to do any fundraising or grant writing, just so 150 engineering students could have something to put on their resume."""

And these populations did face systemic discrimination: see, for instance the story of Viola Desmond: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola\\_Desmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_Desmond)  and the razing of Africville: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africville).  In Quebec, there was an ongoing slavery of both Black and Indigenous peoples: [https://www.historymuseum.ca/virtual-museum-of-new-france/population/slavery/#:\\~:text=The%20historian%20Marcel%20Trudel%20catalogued,the%20course%20of%20this%20period](https://www.historymuseum.ca/virtual-museum-of-new-france/population/slavery/#:~:text=The%20historian%20Marcel%20Trudel%20catalogued,the%20course%20of%20this%20period).\n\nFrom a UBC perspective, it might be worth reflecting on \\*who\\* is underrepresented vs. overrepresented in the student, faculty, and staff populations (and the answer to that depends a bit on what populations we're comparing to).  Certainly on a national and provincial basis, Asian students are overrepresented (but probably not on a city basis), but Black and Indigenous students likely are not.  So I could see that they might want to target based on that.  \n\n\nEdit: and thanks for the award kind stranger!

"b'i think the most important things to keep in mind if you decide to take them:\n\n1. start with the lowest dose that improves your performance and increase it only if it\'s not working. i would suggest breaking the 10mg methylphenidate (ritalin) and the 5mg dextroamphetamine tablets in half. taking too much will tire you out, make your heart freak out, and result in you over-focusing on the wrong things.\n\n2. the initial effects of the drugs include a strong sense of euphoria and motivation, but this will fade after a few hours or maybe a few days. chasing this feeling is what results in taking larger and larger quantities which gets people get addicted, so you need to be aware that this feeling is not the point of taking the drug (if you are using it for studying). the improvements in your attention and working memory are still there even if you don\'t actually ""feel"" the drug working and it should show in your performance. \n\n3. you need to take care of your health. sleep well, stimulants may help you stay up longer but they will not help you perform better on an exam if aren\'t getting enough sleep. don\'t take stimulants later on in the day because it might affect your ability to fall asleep later in the night. be ready for the common physical side effects, which include dry mouth, loss of appetite, cold limbs, etc. keep a water bottle next to you to stay hydrated, make sure to keep warm, and eat a lot of healthy and energizing foods before you take it because chances are you\'ll have no appetite after its kicked in. chew gum to avoid dry mouth. don\'t mix it with other stimulants like caffeine. \n\ni think safety shouldn\'t be too big of an issue if you\'re only taking it short term and you don\'t have any pre-existing health conditions or drug abuse/addiction problems. definitely avoid it if you think you might have an addictive personality or would abuse it otherwise. but otherwise if you do decide to take it, make sure to take care of yourself and try to monitor how your body is reacting. \n'"

Your tuition covers a no restrictions bus pass for the entire greater Vancouver area and more than two thirds of students commute to UBC anyway. \n\n\n3) Crystal mall has ridiculous mark ups on the vast majority of the products there.

Prices won\'t be marked on any of the merchandise and you\'ll always have to talk to the store clerks and try to haggle. A much better bet is just to order online.

"b'Chris Brown abusing his ex-girlfriend a number of years ago isn\'t as insignificant as you think. This parallels sexual abuse accusations coming out today that are destroying careers and lives of various men in the US - just because something happened a long time ago does not mean that the passing of time somehow justifies it. \n\nTo the person who deleted his/her account\'s multiple arguments, UBC being built on Musqueam territory shouldn\'t even be close to a reason to not attend this institution... UBC voluntarily recognizes this in many ways such as by incorporating it into building names, erecting totem poles and so on. Although some may find it crass I do believe UBC is trying. While Chris Brown did offer a public apology to Rihanna, he still has a history of violence that garnered media coverage including participating in a violent nightclub fight, threatening a woman with a gun in her own home and violating rehab policy. This comparison between UBC and Chris Brown are simply not analogous. \n\nAlso, things like gaining weight and doing drugs are horrible epidemics that are very triggering for some but... why is this even relevant here? These are non-violent offences. Gaining weight only affects yourself if you\'re fat unless you\'re counting things like the stigma of being associated with someone very overweight/obese. Doing drugs can only significantly harm the person who is taking it, unless that person is distributing it or forcing it down someone\'s throat. You have presented arguments that are just really grasping at straws. \n\nFinally, you say that you have been abused, along with many others who I know have been abused in the past. How is it ""entitlement"" if someone is emphasizing with Rihanna in this case, who was abused by Chris Brown, when they were abused themselves? Unless that you feel your OWN abuse was justified, I fail to see how you cannot recognize this connection. Would you support your own \'abuser\' if they dropped a fire mixtape? I don\'t think so...\n\nThe promotion of his music by the AMS as well as Chris Brown\'s actions are unjustified and negatively influence the general culture at UBC. You just don\'t support that shit. \n\nEdit: grammar :('"

They are not one and the same, and you can live in a socialist society with freedom of speech, and live in a capitalist society without, and it's not contradictory for either state to exist.\n\nPeople dislike capitalism in Canada because while it may not be politically oppressive, it is economically oppressive to live in a society that demands that ties a person's ability to work with basic necessities like food and housing. Vancouver in particular is suffering from massive housing and opioid crises that can be directly linked back to our inability to provide housing and healthcare to those who need it, and the attitudes that prevent social housing and full, universal healthcare stem from attitudes that people have about capitalism."""

I don’t know if its just me or do people suddenly care about COVID and having online exams?

I feel that the move to online exams would destroy the academic integrity and that the concern for catching COVID in a room where everyone has at least some breathing space is pretty low.

"b'For some context: This has been a quite controversial issue in astronomy for quite a bit now. Mauna Kea, the highest volcano in Hawaii, has a number of modern observatories on it observing in all wavelengths. These telescopes are at the forefront of science; and their data is extremely valuable to the general astronomical community. I have personally used data from 2 or 3 of the telescopes on the site. Currently, there is a plan on building the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) on Mauna Kea, to join the existing observatories. This is a very ambitious project, as the largest ground based telescopes right now have mirrors around 10m in diameter, while the TMT hopes to have a mirror of 30m in diameter. The science that we can get from the TMT will be unprecedented, and it will allow us to observe interesting faint or distant objects that we were never able to see before. The current plan is to have TMT be the last telescope built on the site. \n\nHawaii is an ideal location for telescopes scientifically. The islands are in the northern hemisphere, allowing us to observe northern stars, while the location is also very temperate, meaning temperatures won\'t change much throughout the year. Changing temperatures can affect the delicate mirrors on the telescope, causing them to shrink or expand. This is why the Canadian government is a project partner pouring funding into the TMT, as Canada has neither the resource nor the location to build a similiar quality astronomical observatory anywhere at home in the cold north. (I dont think UBC astronomy club is rich enough to help at all though, lol) Currently, the other next generation telescope (the Europeans\' Extremely Large Telescope) is planned to be built in the southern hemisphere in Chile, so it would be nice to have the TMT be built in the north, to get more coverage of the sky. \n\nThe planned telescope however has been running into conflict with protests from native Hawaiians, who treat the mountain as sacred. The native Hawaiians believe that any development on their sacred cultural land, even scientific, would ruin the land. The protests have been getting increasingly worse as the planned construction of the telescope is starting, with protesters blockading roads and thousands showing up to voice their opinions. \n\nThis is a very sensitive and difficult issue for many, since although astronomers in general tend to be quite liberal, many astronomers are also eager to dismiss native religion as superstition. Thus, you can sometimes hear outrage over some particular astronomer calling the Hawaiian natives as backwards or superstitious. I don\'t approve of this, and this talk also tends to provoke outrage. The Hawaiians are also starting to frame this as a fight between themselves and ""big Astronomy""(which I don\'t think is a thing). All this controversy is further alienating the two sides from each other.\n\nPersonally, I am for the construction of the TMT, as it will have huge benefits for my field and for science as a whole. I tried to write mostly unbiased facts regarding the issue, but I\'m sure quite a bit of my bias slipped through. I\'d be happy to hear from the other side, or from neutral people at UBC about what they think regarding this whole issue.\n\nEdit: A further point about PoCo: The structure is planned to be built by a company headquartered in Port Coquitlam: [Dynamic Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Structures) has helped design or build many observatories in the past, and is also involved in this project.'"

UBC\xe2\x80\x99s policy is in line with other organizations and universities all over Canada: the policy is deal with it, figure out your own way. The bigger problem is that other cities have infrastructure that helps tackle the problem and people who have been conditioned to adapt. \n\nHonestly, if the city just put some money into a information campaign giving people basic tips for driving in the snow (ie, avoid heavy break or accelerator usage, carry a snow-shovel or planks of wood, consider winter tires or M+S all seasons, etc) I think there would be a dramatic increase in this cities ability to handle a snowfall.'"

The ""social justice synonym"" series is a prime example of that. It implies that if I don\'t follow and exercise these claims/assertions, I am a horrible person and am privileged or something like that. Articles like these come off as SJW-constructed and the mental masturbation that comes along with it gets tiresome after a while.\n1. The self-righteous tone of some of the pieces, particularly the ""Talon-approved events"" series. It suggests a united front of all the editors towards certain issues and some sense of authority that The Talon does not. Whether or not an event is sanctioned by The Talon has no significant effect (aside from its readers) on said event\'s properness or moral stance(?).\n\nI don\'t mind if more articles from The Talon grace this subreddit. In fact, I think it\'d be helpful in learning more about viewpoints that I disagree with. When people silence others, it\'s often because they\'re afraid that the latter raises valid points.

However, I have literally seen people plop themselves down and then immediately remove their mask, or they will do so periodically during the exam to drink water or have a snack. I have also had profs ask you to remove your mask for ID checks. \n\n2. There have been no vaccination requirements or symptom checking as per UBC policy. Take a scroll through this sub to see the number of people who have sat near people who are VERY CLEARLY showing symptoms. Or better yet, the number of people who confessed to testing positive, and still showing up to exams, because UBC\xe2\x80\x99s poor decision making has left them no other choice. \n\n3.

You said that everyone has some breathing space, I disagree, especially if your exam is in SRC. \n\n4. Consider the timing. Many of us are soon going home to see vulnerable and immunocompromised family members. Also the spike in cases, with new covid restrictions, that for some reason apply to everywhere except university exams.

Academic integrity is definitely an issue with online exams, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for profs to switch their exams to an online format last minute. However, this could have been avoided, to some extent, with better planning and guidance from UBC. There has been so much confusion and contradicting statements. It was announced, even while other unis were switching to online, that UBC would remain in person. And then, at the last possible minute, it was decided, for most faculties, that the decision to switch to online would be up to the profs, which I believe is extremely unfair to them. However, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about how hierarchy and decision making works with UBC, so this could all be heresy. \n\nAnyways, thought I\xe2\x80\x99d give my two cents. So there you go'"

"\*UPDATE: I am sorry that the website link made one candidate's photo get highlighted, that was accidental and should not be taken as an endorsement. I have replaced that link with another one.

Hey everyone, Isabelle here. I’m the Chief Electoral Officer at the AMS, and I’m here to try to convince you to vote this year. Here’s a few reasons:

1. Your money is involved – your student fees contribute to the AMS’s annual budget of around 22 million dollars. Don’t you want a say in how that is spent? Also, your student fees help pay the five AMS Executives – they each make around $38,000 a year! This is your chance to help decide who that salary goes to.
2. THIS AFFECTS TUITION! One position on the ballot is for the student reps on UBC’s Board of Governors - as you may be aware, the BoG is currently proposing a tuition increase. Whatever your opinion on it, this election is your chance to decide who represents you on the Board when it comes to issues like tuition.
3. THIS AFFECT COURSES! The ballot also includes Student Senators – UBC Vancouver Senate deals with academic issues like extending course withdrawal dates, which they just announced today!
4. Democracy matters – Voting means that you get to participate in your democracy. If only 11% of the student body is voting (this was the turnout last year), that means that 11% of students are controlling what happens to themselves AND the other 89% of students. Real democracy requires everyone’s participation!
5. Your vote guides the direction of the Ubyssey! Your student newspaper’s Board of Directors is decided on this ballot!
6. The SLFS supports UBC students with legal issues – your vote determines who sits on their board!

If you have any questions about the way AMS Elections are run, you can always email me at [elections@ams.ubc.ca](mailto:elections@ams.ubc.ca)

"b'Yes, it is extremely clear that your frame of view is limited to your life experience. I\'m more skeptical of the idea that you truly want to broaden your perspective. If you did, I think you would understand why it is so upsetting that you would invite Lauren Southern to speak at UBC. Yes, she needs to be contested. But presenting such a contestation as a debate is absolutely facetious. You present it as her ""opinions"" needing to be contested, but she is not sharing her opinions - she is perpetuating lies that harm myself and others who have attended or have loved ones who attended residential schools. It comes across as a tacit endorsement of the legitimacy of her views, when in fact it is simply dangerous lies that directly contribute to discrimination and harassment of individuals like myself and my loved ones. There is a difference between an opinion, which is covered in the [Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-12.html), and facts and lies, which are not. Her ""ideas"" are not ideas, they are lies. \n\nIn reading your response to the event, it is clear that you see violence only on a physical level. When you state that the other invited guests would be safe, this seems to only refer to their physical safety, not taking into consideration the emotional pain and trauma of having to confront someone who claims your trauma doesn\'t exist. To me, this says that you have lived a comfortable life in which emotional safety has not even occurred to you. It seems like you have had the privilege to see these issues solely as matters for academic debate and free speech, not as highly emotional and fraught issues that impact people\'s lives on a daily and very real basis. It actually doesn\'t matter how many minority groups you meet with if you don\'t truly listen and take to heart what they are saying. \n\nIt is upsetting to me that you seem to have obscured the more controversial elements of your campaign, and that students may vote for you without realizing that they are voting for someone who does not care about mine and my family\'s personal trauma, who would give legitimacy to someone with such abhorrent beliefs as Lauren Southern, and who would place Indigenous elders in an incredibly painful and flat-out emotionally violent situation, even if you don\'t recognize it as such. \n\nAs an Indigenous student, the best way you could support me is to step back and actually listen to what people outside of yourself have to say.'"

There is one that has econ as part of their curriculum, so you'll be able to meet your econ requirements, and arts requirements in a classroom setting of around 70 students as opposed to 200 students. \n\nAlso, Queens is cheaper... so, it's up to you, i'd do more research and maybe visit each campus if possible?

"b'Literally everyone across campus uses things like Piazza, Dropbox and Google Drive for homework and other school-related material. If US really wanted your information using the Patriot Act, they could easily piece it together and there is very little you can do about it. \n\nBottom line: Even if you are really careful, but you collaborate with others who are not so careful, or the TA uses some US service to backup your graded assignment - you cannot assume your data is private with 100% certainty. I know from experience that many TAs store grades and assignments on Dropbox, Google Docs, etc. even though they are not supposed to.'"

For the purposes of understanding how seriously to take you, would you mind letting us know who you would speak to about the topics in your platform and what *measurable* suggestions you would make to see them implemented?\n\nAlso, I don't see anything about affordability or equity within the university, can you comment on your opinions about them?

[Ubyssey] Taking exams in a different time zone? I'd like to know what options are available to you.
"b""Thank you for sharing. I am not an AAPS member but I do want to share my own thoughts if that's okay.\n\nI think your concerns are valid and at some point, there will need to be a line drawn in the sand, but please consider this:\n\n* Ian is an Educational Learning Technologist. Like many UBC staff and academics, he has a Twitter presence. His job is not to tweet per se, but like academics collaborate with academics from other institutions or banter about pedagogical methods, Ian is an active presence within the educational/learning technology community of practice. Ian collaborates with staff and faculty, both at UBC, and elsewhere across the world and presents on pedagogical methods, on best practices, etc. at various learning conferences and on social media. \n\n* Ian was somewhere in between acting as a private citizen and a UBC employee. Although his lobbying wasn't sanctioned by UBC, he had a legitimate and ethical objection to the use of Proctorio at UBC, and communicated his concerns both to others at UBC by Twitter and to his community of practice. Ian is a learning technologist and Proctorio is an e-Learning technology. This isn't the same as say, a Faculty of Arts accountant decrying UBC Medicine's reproductive research centres for new surgical methods for abortion. He was acting within the scope of his work at UBC, with clear but broad goals for institutional change.\n\n* Although Ian's tweeting wasn't endorsed by UBC Education, he was acting on his conscience in response to ethical concerns. Members of the UBC community deserve to have academic freedom, even if they are just staff or students, and not defending Ian could lead to a chilling effect that could prevent staff at UBC from raising their ethical concerns and righting wrongs in both their own institution, and within the community of practices they work within.\n\nThat being said, I do think it is very fair that you should be able to ask, and hear the rationale for the decision as an AAPS member. I'd love to hear your thoughts OP."""

b'Anyone know a good spot on campus to do power ups? Seems really hard to find those gymnastics polls in china here'
"b""This sounds like 210. I understand that this methodology might be new to you, it is for most 210 students. I'd just like to point out that cs is as much about reading and understanding code and documentation as it is about writing code from scratch. This is a software construction course so this is something that is expected from you. Sure, it is challenging but not at all impossible. Feel free to ask TAs for help. Other 2nd yr CPSC courses will be a lot tougher and self learning is a BIG part of cs. You will get used to it soon enough. Good luck!"""
