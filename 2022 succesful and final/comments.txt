b'bro is acting like catching covid means u have stage 8 brain cancer'
b'UBC subreddit is like a ring with Extroverts fighting Introverts'
b'This is satire right'
b'I feel bad for science students who get their labs cancelled. How are you supposed to learn hands on skills by watching someone else do it on a video'
b'That sucks.  But this is real life. You gotta learn to get past this fears.'
b'Not every individual of a species can adapt when the environment changes. Adapt to it or you get wiped out.'
b'\xe2\x80\xa6deadliest disease of the millennium so far?\n\nLol. This post is peak r/ubc.'
b'Ebola is back? Damn I missed the memo!'
b'In your age range your chances of dying of covid especially if you are vaccinated is virtually 0% so thinking about it as the deadliest virus of the millennia gives the false impression of symmetrical risk. So be safe and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry too much.'
"b'Bro. Please stop. Let\'s ignore what you just said about covid being the ""deadliest disease of the millennia."" The one thing I hate about this reddit is that things can never be right. Somebody is always discontent with the status quo. Sorry, but your reddit post won\'t influence a University\'s teaching methods all that much. My advice: learn some social skills and adapt.'"

b'Therapy'
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a girl in my class that always is shouting out answers and likes to banter with the prof during the class and she\xe2\x80\x99s so loud and I can\xe2\x80\x99t concentrate at all. I think I have adhd and have been trying to get diagnosed but currently I\xe2\x80\x99m not so I\xe2\x80\x99m just struggling a lot with no \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9dreason\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d to be so confused in class. Idk what to do bc our classroom is small so no matter where I sit she\xe2\x80\x99ll always distract me and I barely understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in class when it\xe2\x80\x99s just my own brain distracting me nevertheless someone else being disruptive. I wish classes were hybrid so people who want online class can do them online and people who want in person could do it in person :/'
b'this is so dumb.'
b'I can\xe2\x80\x99t even hold my pencil properly in class from shaking in terror. Glad someone else agrees with me.'
b're-entry is hard.'
b'Eat burger and you will be fine?'
"b""Covid or not I feel like going forward all classes should be hybrid. Not sometimes in person and sometimes online but having the ability to stream in live vs watching recordings.\n\nThe infrastructure is already there. I wouldn't expect the profs to reply to any of the online / zoom chat but I would like the choice of being able to just zoom in if I felt like it.\n\nThe profs could just treat it like fully in person but if you prefer the online route then the option is there for you. \n\nTests, labs, exams, still all in person though. I wouldn't expect the profs to go above and beyond to accommodate the online watchers aside from just starting / stopping the zoom stream."""
b'Stockholm syndrome much? How do you expect to ever function in the real world? May help you to look at actual risk by age.'
b'Idk if this is a joke but I do find in-person exhausting sometimes'
b'Are u in BIE?'
"b""I just tape my eyes closed when I walk down main mall. Makes it so I can't even look if I tried. Helps"""
"b'So, do you spend your entire life indoors? I get being nervous from catching rona, despite your claim of it being""the deadliest virus of the millennia"" which is just absurd! As for social anxiety, a lot of us have developed it to some degree after staying at home for 2 years. BUT this is life... It\'s not gonna happen at your desk, it happens out there where people are at.'"
b'***Ebola and the Black Plague have entered the chat***'
b'deadliest disease bruh.'
b'Some y\xe2\x80\x99all don\xe2\x80\x99t get the joke \xf0\x9f\x98\xac\xf0\x9f\x98\xac\xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
b'Same. SAME. In person actually made me skip class more!'
"b'Ok so UVIC and SFU have already had student led walkouts asking for hybrid learning options. If some of you guys are feeling this way, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t alone! Let\xe2\x80\x99s get together and rally for the PHO to recommend remote and in-person for everyone\xe2\x80\x99s peace of mind.'"
b'The fact that so many people fell for this post \xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
"b""Personally I can't learn anything with online and in person is how it is supposed to be. It's a bit of a rip of a bandaid to return but I know it'll be better in the long run"""
b'Tbh i actually think this is a joke and you\xe2\x80\x99re doing a great job trolling people'
"b""I can't pay attention online, since we went back in person I've been doing very well in class. I have ADHD though and need to seperate where I do work from home to be productive."""
