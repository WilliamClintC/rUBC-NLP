0.074,0.77,0.157,0.9836,"Hi all,

I am a part of this smaller class where the prof chooses to not wear a mask while lecturing. I understand that UBC policy doesn't forbade this but I feel really uncomfortable given that he is the one speaking most of the time, the class is quite small. I feel it would be best for him to wear a mask to keep everyone else safe.

I also find it a bit hypocritical that we are supposed to wear masks (which students gladly do for the most part) but the prof doesn't.I personally don't feel quite safe and it is giving me a bit of anxiety. I understand that I could choose to sit at a distance and that will help reduce the risk a bit but I also want to engage in the class so I find sitting at the end not that ideal.

I don't think emailing the prof would help because he might just state UBC policy and continue to do what he is doing. I am also afraid that he would label me ""scared"" of the virus when in reality I am just trying to advocate for a safe learning environment which I have the right to do. Everyone has a different risk tolerance and my preference is to protect myself and those around me by masking up with a high quality N95 mask all of the time. I also prefer that others at least mask up when we are in the same room and that extend to the prof too. 

I would probably feel better if it was a large lecture and I could sit at a large distance away from him. Overall, I still feel it is impacting my learning experience due to my discomfort. 

TIA for the advice in advance! I am not sure what to do or if I should bring it up with the prof."

0.049,0.913,0.038,-0.6807,"For the record, if you are trans,  and you want to use the bathroom with the gender you identify with, go ahead. More power to you. This really is not about that.

The centre of diversity and inclusion has been spearheading a movement which is seeing the school spending millions of dollars changing over washrooms to be gender neutral.

I don't even get why we are de-gendering bathrooms. Men's bathrooms are functionally different than women's bathrooms. The two genders also use the space outside the actual toilets very differently (socially, etc)

There also the issue that UBC has had multiple incidents of voyeurism in some bathrooms over the last decade.

&#x200B;

I just don't get why this is a pressing issue that the school is spending millions of dollars on. Are we really spending millions of dollars changing bathrooms to appease a very small population? There are students literally living out of cars and using food banks, but this is where we are spending millions of dollars? 

&#x200B;

I would also like to point out the disabled washroom is gender neutral and offers privacy. So it's not even like there weren't already spaces that existed for that specific population. 

&#x200B;

Coming from a ""vulnerable community"" and REALLY struggling financially it gets so tiring seeing issues that impact less than 1% of the student body get millions of dollars of funding while we literally starve."

I know that some of them can make legit money but way too many of them aren't straightforward or can't cut to the chase because they haven't even tried the application process for these jobs themselves it's so stupid.  They're actually even less lucrative than a lot of in-person jobs, even minimum wage jobs. Yes, I've heard so many times that if it's too good to be true, then it's probably a scam, but now these videos are getting more and more deceptive by leaving out significant details about how difficult it is to actually make money online.

&#x200B;

[STOP WITH THESE B.S. Videos if you haven't tried the applications yourself!](https://preview.redd.it/zhnxcmb0mb191.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=8841e4346e854ef789d27ac628361aec79e95d9b)

First, the application process for these jobs are way harder than most jobs that require in-person work. Recently, I've been trying these transcription job websites and they make it seem like anyone can do the job if they have fast typing skills and can speak English proficiently. 

&#x200B;

Second, these work from home jobs videos are WAYYY TOO EXAGGERATED! STOP CLAIMING THAT YOU CAN MAKE $800 doing easy work nobody is buying that B.S. I'm tired of seeing that in my Youtube feed it's so annoying. Anyone that makes these videos is so dishonest and isn't doing anyone any favours and lying to not only their audience but to themselves! If you didn't actually go through the application process for this website, then don't ADVERTISE IT!

Third, a lot of these work from home jobs WAYYYY less rewarding. There was this random youtube video where this woman explains how to randomly making money by doing simple tasks like listening to music or reading, when in reality, a lot of these jobs actually require way more expertise and knowledge such as being an experienced voice actor or high-profile music curator. Like why the hell would you waste so much time uploading 200 music playlists to not even make a dollar like HELL NO!

I could have gotten a job at a company that one of my family members used to work for if my brother didn't selfishly disrespect the manager so much, so now our last name has a terrible reputation there.

I wouldn't have even turned to these jobs were it not for the fact that I haven't received relevant information from the positions that I applied for other than ""Thanks for applying"" like oml I need a job. I wouldn't feel this impatient for getting a job were it not for my family asking everyday if anyone has come back to me about a job application or an internship. Like stop, I'm already applying relentless and reviewing resume and cover letter tips and tricks 24/7.

I'd rather work on developing my hard skills or preparing for my second-year courses or writing then wasting them with this job search! I want to do something more valuable with my time then these stupid, unreliable applications for work from home jobs! Seriously so falsely advertised! I already knew they were suspicious but they're so much worse than I thought.

Sorry for the rant but I needed to vent somewhere."
0.063,0.837,0.1,0.9611,"Like the title says, its sucks that in university you really can’t share your ideas or opinions if it’s controversial, goes against mainstream, or even against your prof. Isn’t this a place where we are supposed to share and learn from each other given the diverse backgrounds, rather than having ideas shoved down our throats? I’ve had an incident, and it wasn’t the first, where I the professor would just shut down any discussion that is even a little controversial. Idk maybe it’s because they don’t want heated arguments, but how the heck are we to learn and explore ideas if we aren’t even able to talk about them and hear what the other end has to say. I think if someone has a different opinion about something we should be allowed to talk about it and explore why, instead of forcing assimilation and ideological uniformity. What do you think?

Edit

Okay, this blew up.. lol. It’s hilarious how almost everyone assumed the controversial opinion was about race, sex, or gender. But I guess that’s my fault for being too vague. My hot take was that the earth wasn’t over populated, it wasn’t even an opinion tbh, it was just a sincere question and I was curious about the evidence that suggest so.

The reaction to this question was students outright attacking me and the professor shutting the question and conversation down. Another thing was in my GWST course where my prof explicitly stated that we don’t have to agree with the theories we are studying about (which i agree) and that this class was not a place for discussion or expressing ideas that would offend others.

At the end of the day, I’m not an idiot, I’m not going to go sharing my opinion on stuff i have no knowledge about. I also don’t expect anyone to listen to or agree with my opinion. What i did expect though was that there would be a chance to voice opinions and have them challenged, and there would also be a chance for me to learn why my opinion is “wrong” or “controversial” or “offensive.”

Even if someone has an opinion that goes against basic morals or human rights if they don’t voice it then it’s never challenged and the person would not get the chance to be educated by the very people who are supposed to be educating them in that given environment.

0.077,0.737,0.186,0.9933,"Unfortunately I'll have to delete this account once the campaign period is over, but for those curious about my political stances, let me clarify:

I believe the residential schools, and the broader policies of the Canadian government were acts of genocide, and that we need to try our best to undo and repair that damage. This also means ensuring that indigenous content gets into curriculums, including content that celebrates indigenous culture and ways of knowing. 

I believe in gay marriage, and publically funded access to gender affirming care, including those under the age of 18 (so long as proper medical processes have been followed).

I believe that we need to work to address any policies which impede the equal opportunity of people of color. 

I believe that UBC needs to do more for students with disabilities, immunocompromised status, or who have family members with those conditions in their care. 

I also believe in the freedom of speech, and that, barring hate speech and calls to violence, the university should be an open forum for discussing all ideas, no matter how difficult. Southern has a huge following, and is local, and needs to be contested, hence why the event was programmed as a debate. The SFE takes care to ensure that all events are free so that students can come and challenge our speakers without financially supporting them. 

Admittedly, my frame of view is limited to my own life experience, and I strongly believe in broadening it through conversations with others, which is why I've met with the SASC, people of color, and asked the Pride Collective to meet before my campaign began. Going forwards I'd like to stay in touch with these groups and continue to discuss the support they need. 

I had a wonderful discussion with students today at the indigenous forum, where they were able to ask me questions about this specific issue. I would welcome more of that feedback and criticism, and genuinely look forward to integrating their ideas into the work I do, and hopefully keeping in touch - whether I'm elected or not.

&#x200B;

edit:

Allow me to clarify here, I'm not worried about catching covid that much, I'm healthy. The problem is that constantly opening and closing school when covid isn't completely gone is ableist and best and negative eugenics at worst. I have the priviledge of being able to take a year off if I really wanted to, but I know that there are people who don't, whether it's due to financial issues or other,  and when these people can't take time off and also are high risk, we are telling them we don't care about their lives. 

UBC earlier put out a statement saying that the risk of spread in education settings is low. This may be true, but does it matter when we are crammed in lecture halls next to those who show up to school the next day after attending a party with confirmed covid cases? I would think not. 

Solution? UBC needs to commit to something. Commit to online until covid is actually controlled, commit to harsher penalties for students who are actively putting others at risk, or commit to hybrid classes so that education is accesible to everyone. UBC already took a year off from in person school last year, but jumped the gun on reopening, just like the government and most countries in the world. If this keeps up, it's going to be a permanent cycle. 

UBC is one of the leading universities in the world in diversity, yet these actions show how little they care about inclusion. "

0.064,0.868,0.069,0.5271,"Does anybody else find the grading for the first midterm absolutely ridiculous (specifically Question 4a,4b,4c)?

The questions are phrased so generically like ""Give the result and clearly show each step,"" and ""Explain why....,"" but then the answer key has some specific exact requirements that are necessary in order to achieve full marks. **For anyone who hasn't taken the course, I can see how this may seem reasonable, but I assure you it is not.** At one point (Q4a), you lose 0.5 marks for not converting your final binary answer into decimal form (even though the question only asks for the binary answer). How is this reasonable? The ""Show the answer is correct, by converting it back to decimal"" requirement in question 4a seems like the biggest indicator of this teaching team's inept expectations- you want me to read your mind? For real? Whenever a student highlights this on Piazza, we receive the same uncaring reply ""From the post: ""We will not answer any questions regarding the exam until the regrade request period is over."" Why not? If you have such expectations from students, why can't the teaching team explain their reasoning? This isn't coming from some disgruntled student who failed, this is from someone who took the midterm seriously just to have gotten screwed over by the teaching team's ridiculousness.

4b is a simple ""explain why"" question, I felt like I blew it out of the water with a simple answer highlighting that the given arithmetic operation was outside the bounds of a positive signed binary representation, yet the rubric suggests explaining how 2's complement works which is literally the most basic concept we learned, it's like asking a grade 8 student to explain how to represent a base 10 number.... The question generically asked us to explain why, it didn't ask us to divulge into overflow or any of the above. If you wanted us to go over that, then include in the frickin question ""Is there overflow/underflow/no error?"" How can you include something in the rubric after asking students to just ""explain why?"" Even though we have full understanding of the material, we can't guess the exact answer you are looking for, **especially when it's framed in a qualitative format**. In response to complaints on Piazza, the professor responded with ""The question already said that it is not possible to represent 32+32, so saying this is larger than 63 is not enough."" But that's the exact reason... we weren't asked to dive deeper into ""why that's the highest number,"" we were only asked to ""explain why"" 32+32 is not possible. If you wanted a more specific answer, then you should have included ""If it's outside of the scope, why?""

Now I can understand the deductions if we were given grade weightings per question, but this 3 part question was just assigned an overall of 18 marks, so there was no way to determine the complexity of each of the individual sub-answers that they desired. 4a and 4b appeared so simple (simply because they WERE easy) but there wasn't any grade weight visibly attached to it (no ""out of x""), so anyone who saw this would probably feel like it was a short answer and provide the basic solution- not explain how 2's complement works! They should have asked us if they wanted it. I finished 4a and 4b in 5 minutes flat, they were probably the easier questions on the exam for me and my fellow classmates, yet I ended up with 4/9 total. My answers were all correct.... and I got 4/9. Do you know how much that hurts after spending hours studying? I cannot express my anger enough. In anticipation, I know I'll get a response like ""effort doesn't equal results"" but I got the answer right, I just didn't ""describe"" exactly what they wanted. And no, these weren't fundamental things that I should have known to include- they were trivial and unnecessary additions. It's almost as if they completed creating the exam and decided it wasn't hard enough, so they just started throwing in grading requirements that were completely unwarranted.

Question 4C was not explained at all in Geoffrey's section (maybe 5 mins tops, and nowhere near the level of comprehension needed for that exam question), so why were we given this? Yes, it was on a slide, but we never dived into it, am I supposed to learn this on my own?

Idk man, I worked for days studying for this midterm. Tens and tens of hours. Walked out of the midterm feeling like I got 100. After receiving my midterm, and ignoring these arbitrary qualitative ""incorrect answers,"" I should have received a 95- but with all of these stupid unclear grading components, I ended up just breaking 82 (I can't even imagine how students who performed worse must be feeling). This is ridiculous. **They aren't even testing our knowledge at this point. They're testing how closely we can predict what they exactly want as a qualitative answer.** Some of you may argue that this is the nature of a midterm but I disagree, we shouldn't have to guess what exact qualitative response you are looking for, especially if our answer is correct and there are no grade weighting attached to each question. **This entire grading process is a slap in the face to any student that spent time studying for this midterm and actually got the questions correct** (especially question 4a,4b, and 4c)**.**

And what's with this whole ""frivolous"" regrade request thing? Be my guest to make further deductions if you find **other** **mistakes** that weren't accounted for the first time around, but to say any regrade that is frivolous will receive deductions.... ain't that your job?"
0.074,0.782,0.144,0.9981,"Throughout my time at UBC I could never fully wrap my head around why people were so ok with the cycle of apathy in the student union. That cycle went a little something like this. 

Students don’t care about their university, so the new students see that and figure they shouldn’t care either. Then because no one cares enough to vote or sign a petition, or run for office, the student body has no actual sway with the administration who can ignore all their demands like increasing housing, getting rid of mandatory averages etc. 

Let me tell you, that approach to life is a quick ticket to feeling like fucking garbage until you die. Taking the low road or the easy way every time you see someone else do it, that will never get any of you closer to where you want to be in life. You should be using everything you don’t like to inspire you. Trust me, I know as well as any of you it’s easier said than done but by the time you’re done at UBC I guarantee you will be happier if you at least attempted to buck the trend. If you want change, and I know it’s cliche, BE THAT CHANGE. Break the cycle. Vote, say hi to a stranger, put gourds on Santa Ono’s lawn until he lowers the cost of something, try doing literally ANYTHING else instead of doing nothing. You realize that your school experience is up to you right? You realize that other schools have actually legitimately gotten what they demanded because the students actually bothered to give a fuck and protested, signed petitions, had sit ins, let alone took 5 minutes to VOTE? 

So here, let’s take the average student sentiment at UBC and then we’ll talk about the variables that are out of your control, then the ones that are in your control. Odds are you’re a depressed UBC student who feels UBC is so cold and lonely, it’s impossible to make friends and no one ever parties and has fun. School is so hard and the administration doesn’t care about it’s students at all and the AMS has no power to do anything.

First, the variables you can’t control - I’ll be the first to admit that UBC is at a disadvantage for student life because of how many students commute. For all the faults in the general attitude/behavior of students, that one is nearly unsolvable in Vancouver (unless you people actually pressure the university to create more housing, but that seems unlikely considering most of you think not voting makes you cool). I get that that’s part of the cycle, if you don’t live on campus, life is harder (in my experience it’s just shittier off campus/at home, I know it’s harsh but I mean it to be validating). Because life is harder you have less energy for school and you become more detached. UBC is also expensive and a lot of you struggle with time and money whether you live on campus or not. I can’t help you there either, student life is tough for a lot of you, it was tough for me too, especially when I lived at home before moving on campus.

Now let’s talk about the stuff you can control. Let’s be real, how many of you have ever even actually tried to find a solution to the vibe you don’t like at campus? Sure you showed up to clubs day, talked to a  few people, put your name down, and then promptly never attended a single meeting or event. How many of you have ever legitimately even tried to say hi to someone in class more than once? Most of you have never voted, never tried to talk to an elected AMS official about your concerns, never showed up to an AMS meeting or started a petition. 


This is the real important one. 
How many of you have ever even walked on this campus and attempted to be the type of person you wish this campus was filled with?


I don’t need to hear your answer, I already know it. I spent the better part of a decade at this university and I could count the number of times I got that effort from anyone. And you know what? I honestly don’t think I ever forgot anyone who tried to be the type of person we all wanted this campus to be full of. I remember Aaron who sat next to me when I was eating alone at a table and said “I noticed you were eating alone and just wanted to see if you wanted to eat together”. I remember someone who will rename nameless, who taught me how to boulder buildings, have some beers and then come down through the fire escapes. The people I sat next to in class who I still talk to today. I never even forgot the joke AMS candidates who tried to have a little bit of fun and entertain us. And ya you know what, I didn’t have success with every person I talked to, and vice versa as well. But those experiences cost me nothing, even whatever embarrassment I felt in the moment is gone, all I remember is being glad I tried. I’ll admit, I was less successful in all of this than I would have liked, but I was also infinitely more successful than I would have been if I never tried and I was a hell of a lot more successful than everyone I saw who always complained and did nothing. Ultimately it was a good student organization that helped me bust out of the slump that I was in (that many of you are currently in) and made me my best memories and friendships, trust me there's something out there like that for you too, but you have to actually try.

I know this might sound preachy so trust me, I wasn’t like Van Wilder other than how many years it took me to graduate, there were a lot of people who did a lot more than me in their time at this University and I still look up to those people today. But all it takes is a little bit of effort, just a few of you coming away from this saying “I will say hi to someone sitting alone next week”, “I will actually stay on campus an extra 2 hours to go to a club meeting” “I will vote and sign a petition against an academic policy I don’t like” and it really does make a difference. Not all of you will have it in you to try being engaged or outgoing at first, I get it, but if you’re on the cusp of making that effort just give it a shot and you could inspire the people who were just a little less ready than you. Throw a field party and invite random people, show up with floaties and swim in the fountain, try to get people to join the stupid ideas you want to do, it’s all just practice and the more you do it the better you get at it.

Oh and also? Vote, it’s so fucking easy."

0.085,0.829,0.087,0.4263,"* Inflation in Canada has been 6-10% monthly this year.
* UBC's budget and numbers are publicly accessible online. UBC is actually running a slight deficit; there is no ""extra money"" that UBC has wiggle room with. In the 2022-2023 projection, UBC reported revenues of 2.538 billion and expenditures of 2.545 billion.
* UBC's operating expenditures will naturally go up with inflation. If UBC does not raise tuition, it will not have enough money to keep maintaining these services.
* A yearly increase of 2% in tuition is effectively a decrease in terms of real money values as it does not keep up with inflation.
* According to [UBC's own budget](https://finance.ubc.ca/sites/finserv.ubc.ca/files/budgeting-reports/2022_23_UBCBudgetReport.pdf), a full third of its expenses are covered by provincial funding. Another third is covered by tuition. Domestic tuition is heavily subsidized by the provincial government. It only makes sense for international students to not benefit from a Canadian governmental subsidy that Canadian citizens pay taxes for.
* The AMS's justification is struggling students and food insecurities. Those points are real. But the solution is for UBC to increase funding on programs that target these low income students (i.e food aid, bursaries). UBC needs to raise tuition to have enough money in its budget to increase funding for these programs while maintaining current services.
* The vast majority of UBC's expenses (2/3) are salaries for staff. These staff also need cost-of-living raises to keep up with inflation. Where will the money to help these staff beat inflation and support their families come from if UBC does not increase tuition?
* University staff are not overpaid. The majority of professors and academic staff could make more money in private industry. These are highly educated people with doctorates and likely years of experience. Their salary data is also publicly available online.

In the end, UBC needs to balance its budget to continue to provide services. We cannot demand both an increase in services while at the same time a reduction in the university's revenue. Students are having a bad time this year. These are poor economic conditions. Everyone is having a bad time. Most people don't want to pay more money. But considering the big picture, it is evident that UBC needs to increase revenue to keep in line with inflation.

The demands of students should not be a halt to increase in tuition. It should be more heavily focused on implementing programs that subsidize students that are struggling. Bursaries, low-cost food initiatives, are good examples. As a student who is not immediately experiencing these issues, I would be willing to pay a bit more in tuition if it meant that UBC could put more towards these programs.

0.099,0.762,0.139,0.9633,"Now I know it's not just AUS, student bodies like The Ubyssey also supports FIFA with their recent article about where to watch the matches. 

But as an arts student, I'll just speak on AUS for now. They have been advertising on their IG about an event to watch one of the games this week, and idk...it just feels super juxtaposed to what I thought the AUS stood for.

Now look, I know people love football/soccer, and will watch regardless. I get it. But it just seems extremely strange for the leaders of our student body to support FIFA Qatar, after all, they (AUS) constantly make it known they care about human rights and justices. But I guess they were just pretending? 

For anyone that doesn't know, the stadium was made by borderline slave labour. Many deaths, no pay, and being held hostage (not allowed to leave, passports taken away etc).
On top of that, they, and other fifa workers, and visitors have reported assaults and r*pes committed by airport security, police, and those in positions in power. 

So, I was curious for their reasoning  and contacted AUS. This was the response I recieved from the AUS VP Student Life (despite being public, not sure if im allowed to put their name due to reddit rules?)  :

"" Thank you for bringing up this concern. We will be prioritizing time at our event to address the human rights abuses in Qatar by making a disclaimer and announcement at the beginning"".

 Now, I'm not angry with this response, and whether or not they actually do that, who knows as I won't be attending because I refuse to support. But, why host this event at all? And I still wasn't really given a reason as to why host a viewing of an event built upon slavery and other human right abuses.

And before anyone says ""FIFA has always been corrupt, why are you just now speaking up?"".
I'm a soccer player and have actually always been against FIFA due to their corruption and problems they cause in the countries they go to. This is my first year at UBC (transferred over), so this is my first time experiencing a student body that's fine with FIFA. So that's why I'm speaking on it now.

I know in the end some people will care, others won't. But it feels gross that our student body would actively support it. It's different than the average student going home and watching. This is our elected student body. I hate that now I know, any future social justice, or human rights support campaigns they put out are just lies so they can get votes. They don't actually care."

0.102,0.845,0.053,-0.9802,"This post might get long but I’m going to try to give the full story as I feel like my situation may cause this to be a possibility. 

In September 2019 I had to take a language class as I was in the arts program and it’s a requirement. This requirement is about the only thing in the degree that I was really dreading to do. I have always had difficulty learning languages. I come from a bilingual family and only know one language. I also had issues with language courses in school. 

I am a student with a disability and registered through the Centre for Accessibility. At the beginning of the semester I met with an advisor there and talked to her about the fact that I’ve had difficulty learning languages and I feel like it’s due to my disability. She said that my disability did not qualify for a language exemption. I could either go through a 6-8 month process of psychoanalysis that would show if I have a difficulty or take the course, show I have a difficulty, and then get an exemption. Since I needed to start taking the language courses that semester to fit my graduation schedule I decided to just take the course as the psychoanalysis took too long to help. 

About a month or so after I learned that I could take the language course for credit/fail. I didn’t know this was the case because it was a required course. By the time I learned this it was about a week after the withdrawal date. I emailed an advisor and explained the situation to see if I could get it switched to credit/fail so my GPA wouldn’t be effected but they said there was nothing they could do. I feel like this was kind of shitty as I went to an advisor expressing my difficulties and they never advised me to take it for credit/fail even though they knew I had concerns of me failing the course and affecting my GPA. I understand there’s some personal responsibility here but I just didn’t know this was an option. 

Fast forward to the end of the semester and I failed the course. The next semester I took it again for credit/fail and passed. However, I knew if I had to take the next course I’d fail as I knew I barely passed. 

I contacted the same advisors at the Centre for Accessibility and went through a process and was given a language exemption as I proved a difficulty learning languages. 

My question is, can I get this fail of the language course removed? As I didn’t need to take the language course for my degree, I have proven a difficulty learning languages, I wasn’t advised properly and could have taken it for credit/fail where it didn’t effect my GPA. 

Any answers are greatly appreciated. Also if you know who I should contact about this please let me know."

0.108,0.786,0.106,-0.6273,"The word BIPOC makes absolutely no sense to me in a Canadian context. I don't intend to step on any toes but the use of the word feels like a lazy export of US issues and vocab to a Canadian context. ~~Black people have historically been a tiny minority of the country(\~1 ish%) and haven't faced the same systemic barriers that they did in the US (like Jim Crow laws)~~ *~~to my knowledge~~*~~. While American attitudes certainly hop the border, I really don't think that black people have the same ""place""   in society in Canada(3.5% of pop) than the US(13.4%) . Furthermore, a large % of black Canadians are recent immigrants(52%), so have not had the historical burden of racism in Canada in the same way as the black Americans(in my view). As an example, Chinese Canadians make up 5.1% of the population and were subject to things like the head tax/non citizenship. Heres a quote from a report Wilfred Laurier commissioned about Chinese Canadians: ""\[Chinese Canadians are\] unfit for full citizenship ... obnoxious to a free community and dangerous to the state."" Why are East Asian Canadian issues not forefront when they make up such a large portion of the population and have been subject to historical racism?~~

EDIT: ok maybe ""place"" was a bad word choice. Would position be better? visibility? idk. Also a comment gave me some more context to historical racism in Canada against black people, so thats why thats crossed out. ~~I also didn't intend the chinese canadian point as a comparison of ""oppression"" I just meant it as a population comparison to another racial group that is significantly larger as a total share of Canada's population. My logic goes something like: The larger a current/historical population within Canada is the more people are affected by marginalization.~~

EDIT 2: Ok yeah, the comparison to Chinese Canadians definitely could have been done better. u/Giant_Anteaters said it really well.  The term BIPOC essentially forces me to make a racial comparison of oppression, which I disagree with.

EDIT 3: to clarify, I'm using population because thats a clear indicator of how visible a group is in general society.

I also don't understand the intention of the word. POC already includes black and indigenous people, so the BI- is redundant. POC really just means ""non white"" so why make the distinction? POC implies that white people are somehow different to everyone else which feels racist to me.

I also take issue with the ""POC"" part. I'm not a ""person of colour"", I'm a person. If someone called me a person of colour to my face I would take serious issue with it. The reduction of my identity to not even a racial group, but only as ""person of colour"" is so deeply uncomfortable to me for reasons I struggle to really put into words

I'm not saying that black people don't face racism in Canada, I'm just saying that I don't see the historical/cultural significance that black people have in America mirrored in Canada.

This is a throwaway cause I'm not trying to get cancelled.

👑 **ABOUT CMD-F** 👑

cmd-f is a weekend-long virtual hackathon designed as a safe space for women\* and gender minorities interested in gaining new skills, building overall confidence, and discovering supportive communities. We want to support YOU, regardless of your background or experiences, in getting well-acquainted with the local tech industry here in Vancouver BC (where we are based) and beyond! To help encourage learning and project creation, there will be a donation to a charity for each project submitted!

✨ **HACKER REGISTRATIONS CLOSE MARCH 2ND, 11:59 PM PST** ✨

We can’t wait to see you at our sponsor booths, workshops, keynote panel featuring women\* in tech, and mini-activities at cmd-f. Whether you're new to coding, a seasoned hacker, or simply looking to get a glimpse into the tech world, we want to help you take your next steps.

We use \* to specifically and intentionally include cis and trans women, as well as women-identifying non-binary, agender, or intersex people and other gender minorities. This event is completely beginner-friendly and is open to women-identifying post-secondary, high school students, and recent graduates (within one year of graduation) from all schools and backgrounds."

With the street being too crowdy to go around, best I could do is to slow down to fast-walking speed, slowly pass by them and pray to god that they won't suddenly make a 90 deg turn and ram into me. With all attention on their phone, they are almost blind, deaf and disoriented at the same time. 

Fortunately I was slow enough that I never actually collided with them, most of the time is a push or near miss that somewhat surprises them. 

If you wanna use your phone for urgent matter, just move to the side of the road and stand still. The ""don't text and drive"" applies to walking as well."

Do everyone a favor and stop complaining. None of us are happy about wearing masks but we do it to protect others. Please be safe and if you are in an indoor public space at UBC, wear a mask.

Edit: UBC is following PHO by continuing to require masks. https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/info/restrictions#masks
""Individual businesses and event organizers can choose to continue requiring masks on their premises."" 

UBC and other universities in Canada are choosing to continue enforcing masks because students are shoved into lecture halls where their ability to distance themselves from others is practically nonexistent. Roughly 70,000 students step foot on to UBC Van's campus every day and 20,000 of those live in student housing. Amongst these students, there are essential workers, caretakers, or people who are immunocompromised. International students like me, rely on our health to be able to see our families again.

I’m a fourth year under grad who has been Uber eats delivering on campus for a few months now. Typically I do it a few hours everyday after class to make ends meet outside of my normal part time job on weekends. I use my bike and it’s obviously been pretty cold recently making the work a bit harder.

Please, tip on your delivery order. I know it’s already expensive, but you can probably afford it if you’re ordering Uber eats everyday. 

To those of you who tip- I really really appreciate it, thank you so much :)

EDIT: I want to thank everyone who does tip - and clarify I don’t feel entitled to your tip. I know how it is studying long hours and grinding through work, I will happily bring you your food. All I am asking is if your routinely order, or have the financial  capacity, to tip your delivery person if they do a good job.

But if you all missed the first part a year ago:  [Probably Final Update? For the Very Cute Guy in the Life Building : UBC (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/rcefe1/probably_final_update_for_the_very_cute_guy_in/)

Well there is a different guy now I guess LOL but this one has very different circumstances.

So this needs a little backstory, I used tinder quite a bit over this summer and there was this insanely good looking guy on tinder that goes to UBC and I thought he was so attractive that I actually hit him up on instagram (this was the only guy from tinder that I did this for) and I think he left me on read.

Lo and behold for the first day of class I was chilling in my favorite building, the life building, between class around 10-11 in the morning and to my shock and awe, he was sitting alone at one of the tables, surrounded by a few chairs that were occupied with bags (I think he was wearing a flannel and a tshirt and I think he's portugese).

I BORDERLINE approached him because I lowkey wanted to ask him out but I didn't.

I was just stuck with the dilemma of if I even should ask him out? Because I shot my shot a month ago and it flopped ig but idk if asking in person makes a difference or just makes me look like a creep?

I have no clue if he recognized me since I didn't talk to him but I did walk past him so idk if he looked at me and realized lol.

&#x200B;

So yeah give me some advice here, should I just try to shoot my shot in person or if this is just not worth it or looks to weird to ask someone out twice after a month.

**Edit: I should probably clarify that we never matched on tinder xd, I rlly just hit him up on instagram after seeing his tinder and asked him if he wanted to go out and get to know each other lol and then that got left on read**"

0.122,0.751,0.127,0.6302,"Kinda debated making a post about this because he made us put all of our phones away while doing said rant, so it's not like I can show a screenshot lmfao.

The rant started out fine with solid educational advice about accepting failure, going your own way, ect, and that is honestly a great thing to tell your students at the end of the semester.

However, cue a very very long winded rant about how he doesn't care about offending people because ""offence was pointless"" and how he ""values free speech"". I personally participate in a lot of activism, and generally the types of people who say these things either either right wing chuds or edgy chronically online bros. Nevertheless, i don't fundamentally disagree with the statement, it's just often used...incorrectly. Like how it was used here.

JT used the civil rights movement, women’s suffrage, and the stonewall riots as examples of why ""offence was pointless"", because the people who got offended at these things occurring were the people hindering social change, and this was kinda the main point of his argument. However, the hole in the logic here is kinda apparent.

Such social movements were only formed because the oppressed groups took issue with how they were being treated in society. You could even say they took *offence* to how they were treated. Saying that their existence somehow invalidates peoples urge to get offended at something is a very poor reading of history.

After all, offence is really just a difference of opinion. This difference in opinion associated with offence can lead to productive change, especially when social issues are spotlighted and discussed. Saying people have no right to be offended is kinda, well, hampering free speech. Something JT seemed to be soooo passionate about.

I know he reads this reddit, so maybe take this as a little bit of class feedback: maybe don't make biased arguments to a captive lecture hall full of students. I see why you made us do our course evaluations in class, before this happened. 


Sorry for the long winded post, the entire thing just kind of annoyed me, pretty fed up with people using offence as a way to be edgy or seem cool."

0.123,0.8,0.076,-0.977,"It's been a whole month since UBC officially rejected me. Studying at UBC had been my dream since I was in my 10th year of schooling. in my final year of schooling, I heard how difficult it generally is to be admitted to UBC, and ""daydreaming"" about it won't get you accepted. I had lost three of my family members which greatly affected my studies and I found it hard to keep up with all the pressure of exams. I play table tennis and I even performed at a national level in the sport too, on top of that I had even represented my school in many tournaments and won in most of them too. My school used to give final-year students badges in different fields(for example sports, music, and dance) and I wholeheartedly deserved to get the badge in sports. however, my principal had personal grudges against me and my family she ended up scrapping my name off her list and gave my post to another person WHO DIDNT EVEN PLAY A SPORT in his whole school life. This event took a huge toll on my mental health and caused me to go into severe depression too.

with soo, many events happening in my final year I was facing a severe loss of meaning and it filled me with negative thoughts. I applied on the 13th of January 2022 with zero expectations of getting accepted and on March 30th I received a mail from UBC that I was accepted. This news made me cry with joy and I felt happy after a really long time. I had to meet their conditions obviously and I started studying hard for my final exams in order to secure my place at UBC.  But life had other plans, during the last week of July I received my results and I had dropped significantly lower than the condition I was given( and I had dropped much lower than expected in maths) seeing this I cried my heart off and was screaming for a whole 15 minutes that ""why does this happen to me only"". Four days later, I receive a mail from UBC that my admission has been withdrawn.

I appealed my withdrawal stating that the death of my family members really took a big toll on my health(but didn't specify the other event since they wouldn't have really cared about it) and I waited patiently for their decision. three weeks later, I received a reply from them that my appeal had been denied cuz they couldn't ""correlate"" with the reason I stated in my letter. At this point, I had lost all hope but kept one last ray of hope in myself after they said that I had the option of sending my appeal to the senate committee. And again it was the same story and it ended up being denied. It's been a whole month since my rejection and it still hurts the same way it did me on day 1. I'm gonna apply again as a transfer student but gonna go with zero expectations since life can be a bitch sometimes. I try to stay strong in front of my parents but they too know what I'm going through at the moment and they are supporting me big time. I'm just hoping that UBC accepts me as a transfer student at this point and I'm trying to be optimistic for the future too. hoping things finally go my way for once."

0.101,0.812,0.087,-0.9252,"Ok, backstory time. I had been in the middle of doing a lot of different assignments for classes (I have 6 this semester, mix between PHIL and CPSC) and banged out my weekly one for this class real quick in a day and a half. I had several hours before I needed to submit (6 or so), so I thought I may as well get another assignment done while I think about what I could improve on the one I just finished. I also didn't submit it because I know if I did, I'd just consider it done and leave it. So I was working on CPSC 313, and while getting stuck on one of the harder questions, I completely lost track of time. It doesn't occur to me until 20 minutes after midnight that I still hadn't submitted the assignment, I panicked for about 5-10 minutes and then sent an email with the assignment to the prof (as gradescope had closed by that point). I also convince myself that, with an explanation, it shouldn't be a problem to get this settled, after all it's only a half hour late, and I've been under a hell of a lot of stress.

I approached my prof the next day and told her the situation, she said it shouldn't be a problem but she was gonna deduct me points for causing a hassle. This of course gets me pretty angry, but I didn't raise a fuss, as I'm still getting the assignment graded at the end of the day. And I didn't really expect any profs to care about my gripes.

Fast forward to a few days before the final, I had just gotten my grades in for the assignment and it was a 0. I asked the prof on multiple platforms what that was about and she eventually replies that it's only temporary and that she's only going over all the ""special cases"" now. I breathe a sigh of relief, life goes on. That is until this afternoon. The day before the exam and she's just told me that she's assigning me a 0 for the assignment due to the unreasonable circumstances surrounding it, and how unfair it would be to other students if she would grade it. She tops it all off with telling me that I best focus on the exam, as ""my assignment grades are fine as they are"", and that it ""doesn't really matter, as the lowest assignment gets dropped anyway"".

Now I've essentially given up on school at this point. Due to shenanigans kinda like the one above. As such, I hardly give a fuck about grades anymore just due to the fact that everywhere I turn it seems there's some prof or TA fucking me over for the hell of it. I don't know why either, maybe because everyone thinks I'm too old to be here or what not or they just take my apathy for the school system as laziness. But despite all that, this somehow still felt different. After all I had gotten her word she would mark it, kinda like a new low for me in this place. It felt doubly weird too, because not only had she refused to give me a mark, but she did so after I had recently joined a club she launched as an extension to class material. During the last session she even offered that I take an admin role in it. However, during that same club session said offer occured, I mentioned that I failed the midterm due to my lack of studying/caring (not out of the blue, mind you, it was prompted in a way) and she took note of it, but I didn't quite catch what her impression was of that fact. Now, I know that last part is kinda out of the blue, but I can't help but feel that influenced her decision. After all, why would she give me a 0 with all these flimsy excuses? Especially after saying she would do otherwise? 

I ended up getting real angry and responded with a pretty salty email, bemoaning the CPSC department and their lack of the slightest bit of decency towards students. Not to mention how angry I was that she had gone back on her word. Not that she had promised me or anything, but I feel like, you know, telling a student you will do something and then not doing it is still pretty bad.

This is more of a vent, I don't expect anything to be done about it, or for anyone to really share in this one particular experience, as this does seem to be a unique issue for myself. I haven't met anyone at UBC that's truly had as miserable time here as I have. And stuff like this really seems to just compound that previously mentioned apathy. Kinda makes me glad that I'm almost done, but also makes me realize that I may need to take a break before I finish, because I don't think I can go through another semester of this so quickly. Weird circumstances however make this pretty hard, so I'm just kinda angry, as per usual, and venting on here kinda makes it feel better.

TL:DR, I'm a salty nugget due to my prof telling me she was going to mark a very slightly late assignment and then ended up going back on her word at the end of the semester. I am also generally apathetic about school. That is all you're missing out on from not reading this.

Edit: I'm fixing some mistakes, mostly regarding tenses."

All my life I've been super lonely - I feel like no one really likes me or cares to know about my passions or kindness or even just my personality. I'm about to graduate and I've only ever kissed one girl, that's right, a SINGLE girl.

Now hear me out, you might think that hey at least I kissed one, right? Wrong. It was in first year (4 years and 3 days ago to the date) and some people on my floor invited me out to wreck beach. Well we ended up playing some truth or dare and someone dared my crush to kiss me. A brief look of disgust passed over her face before she laughed and passed the dare onto another girl (she wasn't as pretty), who after a lot of coaxing gave me a small peck on the lips, after which she ran away laughing with my crush. I never felt so humiliated yet so longing for human affection again.

Ever since I've been trying to forget about it and have been actively trying to date and meet girls. Well I made a tinder at the start of last year when things went back to in person and since then I have had maybe 10 or so matches, and most of them unmatched me after I sent the first message. Same luck at bars when I do end up going, women just assume I'm too ugly/short and don't give me the time of day.

I thought my luck changed this night when my ""friends"" and I went to the welcome back BBQ. We pre drank and there was a cute blonde girl and we actually had an intelligent intellectual conversation. At the concert we made eye contact a lot and she even danced with me a bit. So we go to the pit and we do more rounds of drinks and afterwards she asks if we can walk back to my place, note she said TOGETHER. Oh boy I'm about to lose the vcard! No, on the way back my ""friend""/roommate tags along and the entire walk he's flirting with her, I get so angry but I can't say anything. By the end of it we are already back at the dorm and they start making out in the kitchen so I just leave the living room and eventually I hear them banging in the next room. I wanted to cry and scream and I just closed my eyes and walked outside. I've been up all night because I am just so upset at how pathetic I am, I couldn't even get a kiss from her.

I'm seriously going to graduate with nothing to show for it, this is my last year, I was told university was a liberating time to experience and enjoy yourself, I see all these happy people with tons of friends (that actually like them as don't think of them as walking jokes) and tons of girls and in contrast there's me who no one thinks of or is attractive enough to get a girlfriend."

Hi UBC besties!!

My name is Romina (AKA the girl handing out candy in IKB), I use She/Her pronouns, and I'm super excited to be running for the Senate!! I am a second-year student in the Faculty of Arts hoping to major in International Relations and minor in Middle East Studies. I also lurvvvv Reddit so I'm excited to be posting on here!

This past year I have served as the Chief AMS Representative for the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS), making me both an Executive at the Constituency level and a Councillor over at the AMS! At the AMS I am also the Chair of the Human Resources Committee, and a Councillor on the Governance and Operations Committees. Finally, I am also on the AUS Governance Committee!! Thus, this past year has really exposed me to various levels of student politics and equipped me with relevant skills such as problem-solving, outreach, and leadership, all of which I believe will help me on the Senate if elected!

Onto my platform -> if elected, I hope to focus on three main areas:

**Compassionate Academic Policies**

As we move out of the pandemic, it is important that we continue to prioritize students' mental and physical wellbeing. In working with staff, faculty, and other students, I aim to streamline the lecture recording process at UBC so that recordings for lecture-based courses can become the norm here, even after the pandemic. Recordings are far more accessible for our immuno-compromised population at UBC, and many students (including myself) have benefited greatly from having recorded lectures to study from for midterms, finals, and large papers.

I have a more personal passion project of also advocating to extend the Cr/D/F period to match similar institutions. Simon Fraser University has their Cr/D/F period up to the drop with a W deadline, which is normally after the first midterm. If our Cr/D/F timeline matched this, I believe this would reduce a lot of stress for students, particularly first and second years who are still exploring everything University has to offer and often change their degree plans during those formative years.

**Senate 2023 Goals on Climate Justice and Reconciliation, and Planning for Senate 2026**

The Senate 2023 document is a list of goals drafted by previous student senators to work towards throughout the triennium. As we reach the end of that three-year period, it is crucial that many of the goals in that document are achieved, particularly the ones related to Climate Justice and Reconciliation (in my opinion)! I've linked the Senate 2023 goals document [here](https://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/20210210%20Senate%20Materials.pdf#page=197) (it begins on page 197) for more context, but I primarily want to focus on implementing topics related to Climate throughout curriculums in all faculties here at UBC, as well as making sure the Indigenous Strategic Plan becomes an integral part of every standing committee at the Senate.

I hope to work with the rest of the Student Senate Caucus on drafting another goals document for the next triennium, after a lengthy outreach campaign where we can talk with staff, faculty, and students from various different backgrounds and perspectives to make sure our advocacy is accurate and effective! This leads me to my next point:

**Engaging the Senate with Students**

It's true that many people do not really know what the Senate does. To be honest, I had to do a LOT of research and am still learning along the way! I think a large reason for this is related to a lack of available information as the Senate does not regularly update minutes on their website (more related to staffing issues) and because the Student Senate Caucus has never really had a solid presence on our campus where people can turn to and ask questions.

When I ran for AMS Representative last year, I had similar goals of making the AMS far more accessible and accountable to students. These goals came to fruition in an interfaculty AMS Townhall event we hosted via Instagram Live, where we asked students to submit questions through a Qualtrics form in advance and got those questions answered by AMS Staff and Execs. This was both an opportunity for students to learn more about what the AMS does and hold their elected student representatives accountable.

I think similar events can be done for the Student Senate Caucus, and if elected, I would like to devote much of my time to planning these interactive events, both to increase awareness of what the Senate does and help our Student Senate Caucus in our advocacy work. Further, I'd love to post regular Senate updates right here on Reddit and other social media platforms monthly, so that students are consistently in the loop of what's going on, can provide feedback to us on our work, and can ask any questions they have in an informal setting!

&#x200B;

Ask me any questions you have!! If you have a more personal one you can also private message me here or on Instagram (romihajizadeh or voteromi)!

Two more things: I encourage you all to vote this year, even if not for me, because your representation matters AND because the AMS is doing an amazing Elect Change campaign this year, where for every vote cast $2 will be going to supply vaccines around the world (up to $30,000). I'm sure we all understand just how bad vaccine inequity has been throughout the pandemic, so I hope you all vote at least for this wonderful cause!

Further, I hope you all support the referenda this year! The SASC fee increase will allow this amazing service to continue running, which provides SO much support to students every day. The Bike Kitchen also provides amazing resources to our community and I for one cannot imagine our campus without them. The AMS referenda coordinators will be talking more about these throughout the week so I also encourage you to go chat with them if you're curious about the referenda!

Thank you to everyone who made it this far despite all my rambling (OMG THIS IS SUCH A LONG POST LOOOOOL) and have a wonderful rest of your weekend - time to go cram a bunch of assignments LMFAOOOOO"

Hi, this is just a reflection as a final year student at UBC and a possible advice/support for people like me, I would like to mention that I am an International Student and studying Applied Science at UBC.

Expectations of UBC as a first-year student for me:

Friendly city, UBC ranking below 40 in Global Ranking, and is very supportive, UBC is near the beach and has a lot of facilities to support all your sporting and academic needs.

I would like to say that all these expectations will vanish within the first term or the first year this is because UBC attracts average to above-average students in terms of academic success all over the world and the way it academically tests you will make you forget all other expectations you expected from University and will also make you lie in the bed even if you had time to do other extracurricular activities.

Vancouver may be a friendly city but the people in it is hard to be befriended and as a person like me who expect 50% contribution in a relationship it is relatively very hard and there is a heavy chance you will never find a deep connection with anyone even if you stay for 4 years, study group friends will only be friends during study group, class friends will only be friends when you are in class and Vancouver friend will only be a friend until you stay in Vancouver.

UBC does more than other universities to provide mental health support to its students, but I think most students will never tend to utilize it or will be a thought that it does its bare minimum, The way UBC mental health support will work is it will tend to acknowledge your worries but will never get rid of your problems.

At most all times Vancouver weather will be a deciding factor in your decisions, it will crush all your plans you have most of the time subconsciously or consciously, and the f\*\*\*\*\* sun, where is it????? Which you will always be tending to ask yourselves.

UBC like other universities will always tend to get money from you, the tuition fees you expected and will be paying will be vastly different, especially for an international student on a Budget, UBC will penalize you, and all your mistakes will have real-time consequences and it will induce a great amount of stress in you.

The food insecurity you will feel in this University is greater than in the poorest country you will find in the world, your food will get stolen, and you will face many days where you have eaten nothing considering the budget, the food will never taste as good as your home country and be very overpriced.

Never expect professors like Richard Feynman in this University and you will barely find a few or may never find one, they have their own issues and most of them will acknowledge what the students are going through but they are certainly not angles in teaching, From my 3rd year onwards the classes I have attended is less than 5, Most lectures will make students zone out and not really make you learn anything, I personally found 1 hour of lessons learned in lectures can be learned less than 15 mins if you can spend a focused, concentrated session. Libraries are the primary saviors of this university and will make you achieve the expectations from your course. Of course, you will miss a few intricate details from your professors and can damage your marks by about 5-10% which I think is worth it.

If you would like to think if this is all worth it for the value of the degree and the name of UBC in it, I can prove it wrong too, most of the lessons you learned from the university won’t necessarily give you the skills as the same person that have been practicing the work you admire for this 4 years, the theory you learned from the University can be answered by a couple of A.I’s in the upcoming years and I will give max 10 years before the whole education system will collapse if it doesn’t change its ways. This degree won’t necessarily fetch you more money than the people who have spent working these 4 years. I would like to think of the degree as more of a setback than a push in the world for which you already have lost thousands of dollars.

Now comes the good part, Do you guys really think that I could have achieved this type of reflection if not for UBC, The degree will provide fundamentals for you that you need to sharpen in order to achieve some type of use, UBC will make you realize the true you for which most people won’t understand till 35-40 years of their age, It will make you realize that everyone is facing some type of hardships in their life and the hardships a person can withstand depends on the number of heartaches they already had, it will make you realize never hurt a person because of the hardships you are facing, it will make you realize the things you are grateful for.

I would like to finish off with that even though UBC is not Harvard or Stanford, the amount of stress it itself supplies and the amount of stress because of its nature, location, etc… it unintentionally supplies will make you realize surviving UBC is survival of the fittest and from my approximation, you are already in top 1 % of the world even if you would have survived one term of UBC.

I would like to acknowledge that my reflection will bring a lot of controversies and lots of impulsive decisions could be made. I recommend that you give yourself some time to think about your decisions and whatever decisions you will make should be the best decisions of your life. This reflection is for people who are personally like me, and I agree that everyone is different.


Edited:

I would like to mention that everyone has faced different situations in this University, I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but I wanted to share this as a warning to at least one human that's facing a similar situation as me, I'm not being pessimistic I just want to share this nonwhite washed story of mine where everything is going good. I understand this is adulthood and may have realized this too late. I am not saying other universities are anyway better than UBC in any aspect. I just want to finish this off by even though the world seems so dark there is always this hope and light at the end of the tunnel."

Did I pay for parking? Absolutely not. Why would I? In my 4 years of living on campus I have NEVER ONCE seen anyone put money into those mid century lookin-ass meters! If I’m being completely honest - the fact that they’re NOT all broken is news to me!
So you can imagine my HORROR when,  after 15 minutes, I look outside and see a TOW TRUCK lined up on the rear end of my car???? So of course I sprint outside and start yelling at this guy not to drive away and he starts on this whole scripted spiel about how he’ll “do me a favour” and “won’t drive away” but it’ll “cost me” to “unhitch it” ……………
So 85 dollars later (and yes you read that correctly) I’m sitting in my now shackle-less car, seething with anger, waiting for cars behind me to move so I can leave. But what do I see ???? The damn tow truck now CIRCLING BACK AROUND to line up on a car that is right beside mine!!!! Talk about some meter maid this guy is ???! 
Anyways this is basically now just my cautionary tale of parking in the McDonald’s parking lot. Did I do it to myself? Yes I did. Do I think I deserved to pay $85 for that shit??? Yeah not really

In saying that, both schools continue to invite international students over because they can charge them 4x the tuition. They have taken these huge profits these students and have used none of these extra funds to increase student housing options on campus.

&#x200B;

Housing costs actually went down during the 2020 pandemic, and a lot of that had to do with the lack of international students to the lower mainland. This again is not the fault of international students, it's just the simple fact that supply was actually meeting demand and benefited the consumer.

&#x200B;

Both schools know full well that the international students they are inviting to our area is impacting housing demand, and neither has done anything to build more housing. Both exist in a space where they can build more housing and expiated pace compared to municipalities and both are doing shit all

&#x200B;

Again, not a commentary on international students existence in this space, but a critique of how both universities are letting us starve because they refuse to use the profits they get from inviting students to this region to build more student housing.
