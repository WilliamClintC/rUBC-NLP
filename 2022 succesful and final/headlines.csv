"b""Dumb post imo. All for UBC putting more effort into addressing the housing issue, but this is a weird way of doing it.\n\nIt's not just international students, out of province/city students can cause problems (although imo as an OOP student we get a little bit of the short end of the stick, as we absolutely need housing in Vancouver, but may not have the housing guarantees a lot of international students may have due to scholarships)\n\nWhile UBC may have some responsibility, I'd say the government has a larger role in it. \n\nFirst off a lot of these issues could be solved with better transit to UBC. A commute from Burnaby wouldn't be all that bad if we had a SkyTrain line to UBC already. \n\nNext UBC accepting too many students in general, especially with the fact that first years are gaurenteed housing if they want it, which creates a bit if a false sense of security. Mind you a lot of this is particularly bad this year due to pandemic HS grade inflation, students who delayed their admission due to lockdown, etc. \n\nUBC also needs more land and money for housing (i.e. some of that property in West point Grey) this issue is twofold because housing is so expensive to build that UBC allows private developers who charge Insane rent to build on campus, which can help in short term but cause problems for students not super wealthy as it takes up prime campus real estate with unaffordable luxury apartments, which is already kind of limited. Hell I'd say at this point finding a way to build closer too or on the endge of Pacific spirt park might not be the worst idea in the world. But that's kinda a last ditch measure as it's kind of important as a conservation and research area. Plus it's just beautiful.\n\nLastly the style of housing needs to change a little i think. Sure full apartments with kitchens and bathrooms etc are wonderful and it's cool that UBC has student housing like that, but that's kind of rare and not the norm for a lot of schools. Upper year Dorm style housing with shared bathrooms, kitchens and lounges, less restrictions on personal cooking items like induction stoves would help a lot.  Students may not like this but the reality is this is how student housing is done nearly everywhere, and is one of the reasons many schools abroad even in places with housing crises usually can house most if not all of the students who want or need it. \n\nThis is because it creates incentive for students with the means to live off campus or in private housing to do so (i.e. those loaded international students you're angry about) as it you can get things student housing can't get you like some privacy, versatility and/or luxury, which naturally lowers demand for student housing.\n\nI.e. it avoids situations like the one at UBC where unless you're absolutely loaded, student housing is just by far the nicest and best deal for housing you can get, and you'd be stupid to not put your name on the list as chances are even if you don't want it you can sublet under the table it to someone who does, As it's basically just a nice apartment for the cheapest rent you can find in a 10km radius\n\nAnyways rant over time to crawl back into the closet I'm renting for 700$ a month.

Though I do believe UBC should do what it can to make housing more affordable for students, and it's very likely that it could and should do more, it isn't really the source of the problem. Also, only just over a third of students at UBC are international students. Two thirds are domestic students, and not all of them are from the lower mainland. And even those that are don't all live with their parents. Domestic students have to live somewhere too, but OP only points the finger at international students."""
