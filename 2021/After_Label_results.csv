Abdullah Al-Andalusi is an international speaker, thinker and intellectual activist for Islam and Muslim affairs. His work involves explaining and demonstrating, by rational argument, the intellectual proofs for the Islamic belief system, and promoting the Islamic way of life and Islamic solutions for contemporary problems. Abdullah is of Portuguese and French/Colonial North African descent, and was formerly a Christian until he embraced Islam at 14 after a period of study that started when he was 10 years old. He has continued to study Islam in depth ever since.

**1) What do you do with the clothes you just wore after using public transit or going to public places?**

Do you immediately throw those clothes into the laundry hamper as to mark it unsafe to wear or would you actually consider wearing those same clothes the next day (or even the next two days)?

**Note:** The premise of the follow-up question is assuming one doesn't sweat a lot during that day so the clothes aren't sweat scented.

**2) Do you shower immediately afterwards upon arriving home? What if you need to go out twice a day?**

For example, suppose you had work in the morning and you have to go eat dinner with someone, would you shower at least twice? Once upon arriving home for work and once upon arriving home for dinner.

Additionally, say you are morning-showerer (i.e. you take showers in the morning as part of the morning routine), would you shower three times that day in the above situation (where you had to leave home twice)?

I do tend to get quite anxious over everything and I’m sure this is a large part of the reason for all this self-doubt.
I’m starting to feel as though I’m coming by these grades too easily, and I KNOW this is going to sound like I’m fishing for praise and all, but I’m genuinely struggling with these feelings. I consistently receive grades within the A-/A/A+ range (85-100 give or take, I can’t remember lol) and I have a GPA of 4.33 (idk if UBC does that or if they stop at 4.0). Yet there is a little voice in the back of my head telling me that the only reason I’m doing so well is because this is a community college and that I wouldn’t last a day in university.

First of all, this isn’t about Ian. What he has gone through I would not wish upon anyone.

Secondly, this is not a defence of Proctorio. They have shown themselves to be a predatory company with questionable ethics and poor leadership.

My concern around the AAPS board decision to fund the defence of Ian is based on the fact that this establishes a precedence that I’m not sure the well-meaning board members and executive thought through. First and foremost, I am fairly confident that Ian’s role as a Learning Technology Specialist within the Faculty of Education does not state anywhere that posting on social media is part of his job description. This means I believe that what he did, he did as a private citizen, not as an employee of UBC and so should not be accepting monies for his defence fund. 

The other more scary part of this is does this open the doors for other UBC staff members to voice our opinions on social media, confident that if we say something that one of our vendors, or the institution itself does not like, AAPS is going to be there? If this is the case, then I look forward to that day when I can put my real name in social media to share shit that I’ve seen and I know. I’m sure students and taxpayers would be interested…

And when is AAPS going to share with the membership the reasons why this decision was made? I do hope the board members and the executive will issue a release justifying this decision. How much money or ours did they commit to? I believe in their hearts they may have made the right decision, but again they have ventured into territory I for one don’t believe they thought through, nor understand the consequences.",-1

Also, virus spreading during transportation should not be ignored, especially since the public transportation system is not vaccination-mandatory. Also, there are cases in class of an anonymous post by UBC students, but none of the faculty and the president cares. There is one confirmed case for students in S.R.C, which is the place that 800+ people take one exam together. Scientifically, isn't a larger classroom to make people stay 150min together a placebo?

This is a really simple game theory/behavioural economic conception: people with covid will tend to they are uninfected to get marks, and all positive cases are positive, but the testing itself is the conditional signal. The final outcome because of the pandemic's externality is the worst one, a lose-lose stage (the existing positive case will be less likely to perform normally, and the other students increase the risk of infection. Also, I think only a few of the students experience COVID more than I do. After quarantine in China, I was trained and became the volunteer of my community to the people who came back from the other countries last academic year (2021.2-2021.5), and I also participated in the NGO funding to Wuhan in 2020.

The reinforcement of such stereotypes and highlighting of toxic behaviour and culture can be harmful, and The Plug's lack of insightful questions to the women brings to light a potentially misogynistic culture.

&#x200B;

Another UBC student shared, ""this video makes me sick, especially knowing that these women could've provided such thoughtful and wonderful answers if the questions had been about empowering and relevant topics.""

&#x200B;

Students on Instagram are calling for Nanayakkara to take responsibility as his ""association with the UBC AMS is also a reflection of the AMS' values and attitudes... \[n\]o matter how distanced \[he\] is from the content"". Others share their discontent with ""Kalith, you are responsible for this messed up video... DO BETTER."" Nanayakkara was also investigated early this year for conflict of interest in his role as Vice President of External Affairs in association with The Plug UBC. He still holds his position today.

&#x200B;

AMS President Cole Evans also shared his thoughts below the Instagram post, tagging Nanayakkara and commenting ""caption this shit I want to watch it while I'm in the gal"", referring to UBC's Gallery Patio and Lounge.",1

I just want to put it out there that even though it's slightly difficult, please respect the fact that we are still not out of the pandemic just yet.

What needs to be fixed:

\- Many profs make students collect exams in lecture halls, with everyone crowding and just breathing into each other's faces. --> Maybe it's better to have exam collection times or having single file lines.

\- When waiting at food line ups or line ups at the bus loop, people DO NOT social distance. I know restrictions are being lifted, but until the mask mandate is not lifted, the rules must be followed.

\- Those who have a cold, please cover yourself when coughing or sneezing. Please also stay home if you are absolutely sick. Many profs are accomodating and it's just a matter of asking them.

\- On the bus and skytrain --> Don't shove yourself into people. I know during rush hour there is literally no space, but when there is space, try to sit one seat away from those around you. Also, if possible wait for the next bus/train.

>**""Canadian** government research estimates that **international students** contribute some $22 billion annually to the country's economy and help to sustain over 170,000 jobs."" - CIC News

Hosting international students is one of Canada's biggest industries. I think a common sense government would at least *think* very very hard, of a way September 2021 can be in-person. The Canadian government could give them vaccines, cheap quarantine accommodations, and it would still be beneficial for the economy. 

There are around 1 million full-time university students in Canada, and there are 3.4 million canadians in the age of 18-24. If university students (who have classes in high risk settings, probably more than most of the other 18-24 y/os) are prioritized in that age group so that we can receive vaccinations in early August, we can save the multi-billion dollar industry. 

The risks of prioritizing university students clearly outweigh the benefits. It's a $38 billion dollar enterprise and it is crucial for this generation to receive proper education.

Is the government, who ***just*** are starting to \*\*plan\*\* mandatory hotel quarantine, going to start planning for this logistical challenge? Probably not because they're too slow and dumb compared to countries like Taiwan and South Korea. If other countries like SK, UK, US, EU start having in-person classes while we just sit in our rooms, then I'm going to be extra depressed. 

Although we have lost many of our senior Canadians, the younger generations took one of the biggest sacrifice. We spent over a year of our prime time in isolation. And because of a government who clearly were not ready for a pandemic, our national debt is over a trillion dollars; it's increasing at $10,000 per second. **Guess who's gonna pay for that? Us, who are going to have another semester of online school and feel like shit for another four months, if not life time.**

For the sake of our future and the future of our country, **we NEED better education.** That's my conclusion. The government should at least work their ass off to make Fall 2021 happen.

If the government really cares about students and the Canadian university industry, they should put us in priority and put some accomodation. We are future taxpayers and you guys, the government, owe a lot to us. It's hard to listen to online classes if i know that my salary in the future would be going towards paying the national debt.

UBC will not mandate masks, or vaccinations but will effectively mandate in-person attendance for most students. Do people really not understand why some of us are reluctant? 

I'm happy people who hated online school and had deteriorating mental health will get to go back to in-person classes. I'm glad you have that option now. I just want UBC to give us some options too. You know what also f-cks with mental health? Not being able to vaccinate for legitimate reasons yet forced to attend huge lecture classes. Commuting for hours on busses or trains with no social distancing. Worrying about getting covid and passing it on to vulnerable loved one. Having our concerns ignored or minimized. 

Yes, BC is supposedly on a good trajectory right now. The fall semester might turn out perfectly ok (and I hope it does), but that's based on the assumption that everything is going to go according to plan. Am I worrying too much? Maybe. But honestly, so what? Is it so unreasonable to want some extra options or precautions in place for a few months as we transition (or more accurately, thrown) back to in-person learning? Imagine wanting a little extra leeway when we literally are still going through a worldwide pandemic where millions of people died while many others are still suffering long-term effects?!?! WHAT A WEIRDO.

EDIT: Thanks to the few who responded kindly. 

It's funny how some seem to have loads of empathy with those who will not vaccinate for selfish reasons and can spread the virus to others, but not for the rest of us. UBC gets ragged on all day every day, but when it comes to this, suddenly you are UBC's greatest defender.

Also, unless you are a professor, stop repeating that UBC is not an online school. As much as I dislike it, I can understand how this affects them (e.g. workload, classroom  pedagogy) and I respect that. These are not things that affect you in any way. I don't understand why you are so against UBC offering online OPTIONS, unless it's because you think if students are not forced to be there in person, you'll find out you actually don't really have friends in real life?",1

* Our lowest scoring quiz is excluded from the calculation of our grade. 
* Each quiz is scaled so that the class average of each quiz remains constant. 
* It is unclear if the professor will exclude blank quizzes from the calculation of the class average.  

Heading into the final quiz, it seems that some of my classmates are happy with their first few quizzes, and so plan to skip the final quiz. Is it ethical for these classmates to try to get only a couple points on the final quiz to 

1. ensure their score will be calculated in the class average, and
2. to lower the class average so that students who are trying for the final quiz get curved to a higher mark? 

Would it be ethical to encourage this behavior, and to not point out this loophole to the professor?  

Put another way, I'm having a moral dilemma on whether or not it's ethical to not try your hardest on an exam. In sports this would be a bit analogous to match fixing. On the other hand, it's an opportunity to help other students without any personal gain. 

I don't believe this behavior is covered in the academic misconduct rules of the calendar.

I will say that this situation has been incredibly hard on me and a lot of the other Indigenous students I know. UBC has a flat out bad track record in the treatment of Indigenous students (and faculty, but that’s another matter). We are tokenized, erased from the classroom, our place at this institution is constantly questioned. Wolf is, at least, 100% right in saying that UBC is a racist, colonial institution that exists illegally on stolen land, for which they pay no rent and make little apology for occupying. I personally have been told BY MY PROFESSORS that residential schools were a good thing, that there aren’t Indigenous students in the classroom, and that colonialism is over. It is difficult to describe to settler students what the Indigenous experience at UBC is, and I’ll add the caveat that my experience and opinion is just one of thousands, and Indigenous peoples/experiences are non-monolithic. 

With that being said, when this controversy first popped up about a month ago, neither I nor any of the other Indigenous students I talked were surprised that it appeared UBC was attempting to silence an Indigenous professor. It has happened before and will happen many more times. Again, we hear bad settler takes on Indigenous issues all the time. Cue the downward spiral into ~whatever the fuck is happening~, which I am generally trying to ignore. 

I am mostly here to talk to other Indigenous students about how this situation has us feeling. I am your classic west coast mutt and I am also light-skinned, and all this nonsense about DNA tests and Indian status and “proving your are Indian enough” has me really hurt and upset. It is so clear a lot of the settlers on this subreddit have no clue about Indigenous identity or Indigenous issues. Also, raceshifting and false claims to indigeneity are serious issues, and it truly seems like there is a constant stream of white people lining up to claim indigeneity to receive funding/job opportunities/clout/access to indigenous knowledge, especially in academia. 

So I would love to hear from other Indigenous students. I know I at least have felt very very isolated during this whole situation, with even my close settler friends not understanding why the ignorance in this conversation is hurtful.

The issue is I have no problems getting interviews from small or mid sized companies ( I feel like I can get 1 interview per 2/3 applications as right now I am getting lots of interviews which allows me to be very picky). However, I am not getting interviews from big techs ( apart from tesla, SAP at which I am waitlisted for fall and autodesk). Basically any company that uses ATS discards my resume.
My resume is highly parseable (I tested it on several APIs as well as on workday) which makes me think my resume is not key word optimized.
So I am thinking of hiring a professional resume service to keyword optimize my resume for certain jobs and learn the process. I am willing to spend upwards of 1k and even more if required.

Has anyone hired or did anything similar for any jobs not necessarily in CS? Would you mind sharing your experience?

In early March, [UBC announced](https://broadcastemail.ubc.ca/2021/03/08/increased-on-campus-activity-for-the-2021-22-winter-session-2/) that we are “planning for a return to on-campus activity for Winter Session, Term 1, in September 2021.” This decision was based on the [advice of the Provincial Health Officer](https://covid19.ubc.ca/files/2021/03/1190387-Letter-to-PSI-Presidents-final.pdf). It was made after careful consideration of various factors including the pace of vaccinations in Canada and the importance of in-person learning to the overall experience of students.

We would like to reassure you that health and wellbeing of our UBC community is of paramount importance as we chart our plans for a full return to campus.

**What does this mean for Applied Science Students?**  

\-  You are expected to be on campus (e.g., to attend in-person classes) for September 2021.

\-  Applied Science is planning to offer courses primarily in-person and as such the selection of courses offered fully online will be limited.

\-  If you are unable to come to campus for reasons beyond your control, we’ll do our best to support your degree progress but there will be no guarantee that the courses you need will be available online.

\-  A set of relevant FAQs that include information about housing, health and wellbeing and other services is available at [https://covid19.ubc.ca/information-for-students](https://covid19.ubc.ca/information-for-students).

Our plans for September are subject to the health and safety protocols as defined by the Provincial Health Officer. If there are substantial changes, we will provide you with an update to our plans. For the most up-to-date information from the university about our return to campus, please continue to visit [covid19.ubc.ca](https://covid19.ubc.ca/information-for-students/). Meanwhile, we are working across the campus to provide specific course information in advance of your [registration date](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/registration-dates).

We recognize that this continues to be a challenging and uncertain time, and your wellbeing may be impacted – you’re not alone and we encourage you to access the support resources available to you as a UBC student at [students.ubc.ca/support](https://students.ubc.ca/support).

It kind of sucks how they are not addressing the issue of the fluctuating +1000 cases per day on top of the fact that our university probably has the most international students in Canada. The last paragraph is basically UBC's way of saying ""We are sorry, but not sorry at the same time"".  


Also, I don't understand why we are expected to attend in person classes. Wouldn't  a combination of in-person test and online lectures just be good enough? My parents has type-1 diabetes and won't even get their second shot of the vaccine by September...",1

Anyways, when I first came to UBC (as an official student), I expected more open socialization. After all, we've matured far beyond cringeworthy high school cliques.

But...

Actually, let's start with an apology: That are-you-okay-you-sound-like-you're-choking-on-a-sword ""*OhhHhHHhhHh*"" sound was not meant to be rude. It was just an involuntary reaction because, well, no one has ever walked up to me and said something so baffling in my life. Or maybe I practised my French R's too much in high school.

Ahem. Let me clear my throat. It is a difficult phrase, yes? It was something like this:

""Hey, you have really cool hair.""

I know what you're all thinking, everyone. I said, ""Thank you.""

No. No. *No.*

""*OhHHhHHhH*.""

For emphasis, let's repeat that.

""*OhHhHhhHHhhhhHHh#e8grbn2teijgiowr45g.*""

As you can see (or hear), I was quite ex*quis*itely articulate.

To clarify: I was not trying to be rude when I waited an indefinite amount of time to expel the following:

""Uh... Erm... Urgh... Tha-anks.""

It was at this point—well, after too long of a period of awkward eye contact—that you suddenly exited the room with the strange magic extroverts expel like unicorns that ate too many rainbows.

""Sure!"" you exclaimed. (Or some similar phrase.)

I soon reported this to the Official Introvert's Emergency Laugh-at-Me Centre, otherwise known as my friend who sits next to me in CHEM 121. We laughed about this until the lecture began. Thou art famous now, at least amongst a national population of two.

""*OhHhhHHhHH.*""

I didn't react like that on purpose. I promise! You just weirded me out. A lot. I hope *that* doesn't come across as rude. It was just so, *so* random.

After this near-death experience, I proceeded to my seat—this is before the portable OIELMC arrived—and pulled out my phone, checking my hair for quantum chemical anomalies. Alas, some hair was sticking out slightly, but you could only see it if you looked for it.

I proceeded to think about this life-threatening incident on the bus, SkyTrain, and other bus home. (It's an hour to reach where I live.) This impressed upon me many philosophical questions, such as the following:

* Am I actually bald? Have I been hallucinating my entire life?
* What is hair?
* Do unicorns really eat rainbows?

(If anyone has answers to these questions, I'm sure UBC would be more than happy to grant you a PhD in Philosophy.)

But perhaps the strangest part of the whole situation is this: My hair doesn't usually look like this. I've just been too lazy to cut it.

Sincerely,

A random first-year

0.13,0.722,0.148,0.7199,"There are tons of universities trying to make vaccinations mandatory for their students or staff, if not, both. 

Many regard it as a “good measure” and labeled those who rejected or even being dismissive towards such scheme as “anti-vaxxers”

But, isn’t forcing the majority of its students or staffs to vaccinate a bit radical, if not, unethical? For, not only the vaccines are only approved by the FDA under emergency, we are also forcing them to take  a risk (a risk which could directly result in one’s death or other long term untreatable medical conditions, no matter how small the actual risk really are)

I, myself, is not a anti vaxxers for I have had vaccines countless of time throughout my entire life. 

But, I think the case is a bit different for COVID-19 vaccines. For most COVID-19 vaccines including the BioNTech, uses the mRNA technology which is a relatively new technology unlike past vaccines which are inactivated vaccines. The LONG TERM side effects have not yet be known, obviously, as it is only developed in 2020. 

Another point worth mentioning is the intrinsic difference between mandating the public to inject vaccines and mandating them to wear a mask at all time/ making the public to abide with social distancing rules. The latter would pose no risk to the individual (unless people suffocated and died because of wearing a mask). If this is not the case, people preferences (mask-lover or not) should be overridden in favor of public health for such policy can create the greatest utility (i.e. most pleasure and least suffering) as the pandemic is contained and less people are infected/ affected by it.

The prior (mandatory vaccination) is different. Those who injected obviously have less chance of being infected or infected others. However, they alone bear the risk (once again, no matter how small it is) of getting serious/ life-threatening side effects. Making vaccines mandatory would mean forcing them to make a wager on themselves in favor of others which can hardly be ethical.

An analogy can be made here: A doctor may think the best treatment for a cancer patient is a surgery as his/her cancer is at early stages and that there is 99% chance of the surgery succeeding and a only 1% chance of him/ her being more ill than before. The choice still lies on the patient for the doctor cannot choose on behalf of the patient. It is a foundational principle of medical ethics that consent must be given for any procedure


TLDR: I don’t think making vaccines mandatory is ethical. However, I do think it should be encouraged by giving incentives to those who choose to get vaccinated. For example, shortening their quarantine duration or required those who refused to vaccinate to conduct regular tests. 

As a philosophy major, I welcome any counter arguments. But please don’t use Ad Hominem or call me a anti-vaxxer becoz I am rly not one:) 

If you’ve read through all of it, Thank you!

Hey everyone, Isabelle here. I’m the Chief Electoral Officer at the AMS, and I’m here to try to convince you to vote this year. Here’s a few reasons:

1. Your money is involved – your student fees contribute to the AMS’s annual budget of around 22 million dollars. Don’t you want a say in how that is spent? Also, your student fees help pay the five AMS Executives – they each make around $38,000 a year! This is your chance to help decide who that salary goes to.
2. THIS AFFECTS TUITION! One position on the ballot is for the student reps on UBC’s Board of Governors - as you may be aware, the BoG is currently proposing a tuition increase. Whatever your opinion on it, this election is your chance to decide who represents you on the Board when it comes to issues like tuition.
3. THIS AFFECT COURSES! The ballot also includes Student Senators – UBC Vancouver Senate deals with academic issues like extending course withdrawal dates, which they just announced today!
4. Democracy matters – Voting means that you get to participate in your democracy. If only 11% of the student body is voting (this was the turnout last year), that means that 11% of students are controlling what happens to themselves AND the other 89% of students. Real democracy requires everyone’s participation!
5. Your vote guides the direction of the Ubyssey! Your student newspaper’s Board of Directors is decided on this ballot!
6. The SLFS supports UBC students with legal issues – your vote determines who sits on their board!

While many student struggle to fund their educations, 15 million in scholarship dollars go unclaimed in Canada each year.

This program will create a system in which students can build a profile using their career interests, sports career, specialization, and other extra curriculars to get connected with scholarships based on their interests and skills. 

This program will be funded by an optional $10 annual fee to be included in your student fee. Again this fee is completely optional and can be easily opted out of if this is not something that interests you.

 If you want to see a program that could help thousands of students avoid debt for years to come please take a minute to sign this petition. All you need is your student number.

*""open book/open notes/internet allowed exam. You may not work with anyone else. Collaborating with anyone else on the exam will result in a report of academic misconduct.""* 

We have had 2 classes since the he posted the exam results and feedback and he has not mentioned anything about the midterm/anything wrong in general. I had recently checked the feedback for the midterm and one of my feedback for one question (that I had copied off Chegg, I hate myself) is that, it was the answer for one of his other class (who took their exam a day before our class). As you can see, its been 4 days since the feedback has been posted and we have had 2 classes already without him mentioning it in class or calling a person out.

Since reading that feedback, I've had bad anxiety issues that leads to severe concentration issues and emotional breakdowns. I have not received any emails from my professor or any emails from the school about it. Am I thinking too much into it? Should I fess up?

Remember when there were few posts about lecture recordings staying even after the pandemic?

1. **For big lectures like 50+ people,** we have lectures that students can attend in-person, and also provide the option of lecture recordings (or live streams). Students who aren't vaccinated, or immunocompromised can watch/participate in the comfort of their homes until they're vaccinated. It will only be 10 or 15 students on the first few lectures (with social distancing) and it will gradually increase (with social distancing) as we all get vaccinated. 
2. **For labs which require physical equipment,** we can have in-person labs. Chemistry currently has small in-person labs, which they can ramp up by fall.
3. **For labs/tutorials/discussions not requiring physical equipment,** we can have parallel implementation. So we have a section of in-person labs/tutorials/discussions, and the online version running as well. As long as the delivery is smooth, there wouldn't be a difference in terms of content between online and in-person.
4. **For lectures with 30 to 49 students,** we can either have zoom classes or in-person with social distancing depending on the ability to accommodate the appropriate spaces.
5. **For lectures with less than 30 students,** it can be in-person with social distancing.
6. **Office hours can still run online.**

**All of the above assumes that in-person classes still follow social distancing with masks.** 

Of course, setting up professional lecture recording cameras, microphones, software, etc would come with a lot of costs. But clearly the benefits outweighs it, as on-campus businesses like residence, food services can run properly and make $$. And this recording infrastructure will stay to serve for future years after the pandemic. Other European countries have this infrastructure and there's not much reason why UBC shouldn't. 

Again you might say ""it's not feasible"" but other universities have been doing it. It's more work for higher up executives, and... as we've seen, UBC execs are quite lazy for new initiatives.. There are 129 classrooms that have 50+ capacity. Get those cameras/microphones up, hire more UBC IT Audiovisual staff for support. It's doable.",1

Thoughts:
- Comments on the Instagram announcement are limited, which feels a lot like when Fox disables comments on YouTube, and is a total piss-off
- That comments are limited on posts like this does not make students or staff* feel like opinions are valued
- It would be *so easy* to use this as a springboard for ""Out of an abundance of caution and in response to calls from several university constituents, we have decided to implement a mandatory indoor mask policy on all UBC campuses when in-person instruction resumes,"" but that would unfortunately involve listening to students and staff

Yes, I realize that the university admin is hiding behind health authorities on this one, specifically Interior Health in the Okanagan... *But come on!* Even just throw in a cursory mention that it applies to all campuses, just nonchalantly, and it would put so many people at ease.

This is all deaths since the beginning of the pandemic by age in Canada, most of which had no vaccine. If you are vaccinated, you are incredibly safe now.

It is also worth mentioning that 0-29 made up \~40% of all confirmed cases, and likely more than that.

You can't just trust the science when it aligns with your beliefs. Vaccines work. Because they work, you really have no business telling other people what to do. You are not in danger.

Edit: This post is not to dismiss people's worries, but to put them in perspective. Most students are in far more danger driving to school than being at school.

I don’t know if its just me or do people suddenly care about COVID and having online exams?

I feel that the move to online exams would destroy the academic integrity and that the concern for catching COVID in a room where everyone has at least some breathing space is pretty low.

One solution is bringing multiple mask(s) and switching them out and then wash these masks once I return home. 

Other than wearing those disposable masks, I was wondering if there are alternatives to this. I am looking for either products or methods to safely handle/ maintain mask wearing.

0.068,0.784,0.149,0.989,"\*\* update: not talking about people who have refused the vaccine, I am talking about people who cannot get it for various reasons.

edit: Also, can someone explain why if I get 2 does of the Pfizer vaccine, which is \~95% effective, why I would still be at risk for covid? 5% chance of developing symptoms is pretty low. My current mindset, and part of the reason I feel like it shouldn't be mandatory, is that once I receive the vaccine I am at very low risk for developing covid, and should not worry. Is this wrong?

Unpopular opinion, but I do not think UBC should require students to be vaccinated this fall.

I support scientific and medical research (and as a science student understand it enough to develop my own opinions based on the data and research), and will be getting the vaccine myself when it is available, however IMO it should not be mandatory at UBC for a few reasons.

1. UBC is a public institution, and from my own research it seems to be against the Canadian Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms to force all students to be vaccinated, as well as go against religious freedom for some people [https://thehumlawfirm.ca/can-employers-require-employees-to-get-the-covid-vaccine/](https://thehumlawfirm.ca/can-employers-require-employees-to-get-the-covid-vaccine/)
2. International Students may not be able to receive the vaccine in their home country by September, and with the timeline of vaccine rollout in Canada consistently changing, and Pfizer now approved for kids over 12, it may not be feasible for Canada to offer vaccines to international students by September. (edit: after Canadians who want it receive 2 doses, I sure hope it will be offered to other countries. )

I feel like it is not fair for UBC to only allow international students back who are vaccinated, because it punishes students who live in a place where they have not had the opportunity to receive the vaccine.

anyways, I hope this post sparks debate and I would love to hear why you agree or disagree with any of these reasons! Let me reiterate I am not anti-vax, and I support getting the vaccine. I just do not think it should be mandatory for UBC students in September.",1

In rare cases, we saw Delta infecting the vaccinated but only with mild symptoms. 

 The current resurgence of Covid in many provinces is still due to Delta variant (as the dominating variant), nothing has changed except a new variant (Omicron) popping up on the side as the non-dominant variant. Even with Omicron, no data suggests more than an above-average hospitalization rate after vaccinations. So why are people now switching their opinions? You got what you wanted...you can't demand in-person school and not expect in-person testing!

I never wanted in-person school but it's weird watching y'all cry during finals and making non-evidential justifications for online finals. Learn to live with the consequences of your demands/decision. We all knew before starting the semesters that more variants popping up was not a surprise.

Hi everyone – students and professors. There's been a lot of conversation on here lately about how many of us are anxious about returning to campus. Case numbers in BC are rising, the Delta variant is becoming more and more prevalent, and modelling shows that hospitalizations could reach new record highs by the end of August. 

In order to keep everyone at UBC safe and healthy this fall, the university should make vaccinations mandatory for all students and staff, and require masks in indoor spaces. Please sign [this petition](http://chng.it/tSr44sfybr) (the link is also at the top of the post), so that the university can hear our voice and make the changes necessary to protect the entire UBC community.

As Dr. Darryl Leroux and several redditors have suggested, what Dr. Amie Wolf is going through right now seems to be a matter of mental health. Delusion, grandiosity, violence, and egomania are all symptoms of a manic episode for Bipolar I. These things can boil beneath the surface for a long time, appearing to outsiders only as unpleasant personality traits when, in reality, the 'perpetrators' are only victims themselves.

I'm in my second year of UBC, and for the same amount of time, I have been living in student housing. Also for that amount of time, I've been absolutely BAFFLED at the rules that UBC Housing has laid out for us. I'm gonna list the ones that I find mind boggling before I propose my plan.

&#x200B;

Rule #1 Section 1.31 of the Winter Contract

Residence rooms and shared units are furnished. **Additional furniture and appliances are not permitted** to be placed in your room or common areas of your accommodation without prior written authorization from the Residence Life Manager 

&#x200B;

Rule #2 Section 3.14 of the Winter Contract

Residents may accommodate overnight guests in their rooms for a **maximum of four (4) nights** in any given month. Residents may be evicted for guests’ stays which exceed this period of time or are a disturbance to the floor, unit/apartment 

&#x200B;

Wonder what my problem with these rules are? No worries, I will explain.

&#x200B;

Rule number one bothers me mostly because HUH? why can't I bring in a new piece of furniture into MY PLACE? I currently have a coffee table in my room, but if my RA found out, I could potentially be EVICTED, just because of that. Unfair, don't you think?

Rule number two is more of a partisan issue in my experience, however, I must ask what the reason for four days is. Why not 3? 5? Why is there a limit at all? What counts as having guests over for a night? Do they need to sleep over? What happens if they're over but they don't sleep? What counts as staying over or just staying late? What time does it cross from being over late to being over for the night? Does it count as a night if they leave at 5 am? What about 6? Where is the line drawn? 

None of this is addressed in the residence contract (I would know).

&#x200B;

So this brings me to my ""plan""

&#x200B;

We need these rules to either be better defined, or abolished completely. If I had my own apartment, I would be able to keep a mf over for as long as I wanted. And I sure as hell would be able to bring my OWN FURNITURE? How does UBC Housing benefit from these almost arbitrary rules?

I had my friend over for four nights and my roommates were so scared that they were gonna get in trouble if he stayed over one more night and were threatening to report me to the Residence Association if he did not ""vacate the premises immediately"" (thanks for the support guys)

Why must we be forced into such an unfair and restricting contract? You wouldn't see this bullshit anywhere else, AND I pay more for student housing than if I DID have my own apartment. (btw I started renting my own apartment to get away from this clown show, so no need to comment ""if you don't like it just leave"")

Don't we come to UBC to be able to become independent adults? Because it sure as hell doesn't feel like it when I'm worried that the big bad RLM is gonna come knocking any day asking me if I have any illegal chairs in my room. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

STUDENTS

We need to demand better from the people we rent from! Otherwise what will future students think when things potentially become even more restricted in the future? This is no way to live. 

&#x200B;

So what can we do?

I don't know about you guys, but I'm calling my RLM. So what if they catch me with a coffee table, or a guest staying for five nights instead of four? We need to call out bullshit rules when we see them, otherwise future students will be worse off in the long run for it. 

&#x200B;

(TL/DR)

There's some bs going on in the residence contracts, and frankly, I'm sick of it. Live in residence? Call your RLM and demand a change, or at the very least, get you and your friends to buy a chair for your kitchen table and see how many of us they can catch!",-1

I'm trying to get into some sports this year (tennis, volleyball, and rock climbing!!) so we can buddy up for those. Good luck to everyone this year, feels like it's gonna be a lot lmao",1

I was so frickin confident going into the COMM 205 and 294 final exams. I spent around a week studying for both of these exams as I really wanted to get A+s in the classes. However, after hours and hours of studying I barely hit 80% in both of these final exams with a final grade of 89% in each of these classes.

&#x200B;

I've come to the realization that:

I'm just not doing something right. I'm not studying the way students who get A+s study. I'm screwing myself over .

&#x200B;

Either way, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being beaten by my peers. Some people may read this and think I'm overreacting (or fishing for compliments) for getting 89% as final grades, but this is really pathetic when you consider how hard I tried this past year. I studied for both of these classes like crazy. I didn't leave my house more than 5 times the entire semester. 5 times the entire semester! I kept up with the COMM 205 ICE exercises all throughout the semester (getting perfect on the ICE, iclickers, and assignments).

With all the hours I spent studying, all I got was 80% on both final exams and a 89% final grade in both classes, and no matter how many people say this is a ""good"" score- in reality its pathetic when you've spent so much time studying. Yes, these would be good scores if I had not spent every day of the semester studying for these courses. They would be good scores if I had maintained a social life and gotten exercise. But the truth is, I don't care about these other things.

2 students got 100% (and many more got above 90%) on the COMM 205 final exam.

A bunch of students got a final grade above 90% in COMM 294.

1 UBC student got accepted to Stanford last year as a transfer after failing her first math midterm.

1 Sauder BUCS student got into MIT for grad school last year.

To these students, what am I doing wrong? Why can't I frickin hit 90s easily after spending that much time and effort? I'm sick of being an idiot. Elon Musk spent his college days arguing with professors that his 98% was really 100%, Mark Zuckerburg got 100% in all of his classes at Phillips Exeter Academy. I don't care if comparing yourself to others is unhealthy- I want to develop the habits and skills of successful people, and at the very least, that means getting A+s when you put in all that effort.",-1

When I turned around to walk back to my desk, I noticed a sheet (or was it two stapled together?) of paper with my name on the professor's lectern. I was a little taken aback by that; I mean, I have only attended three (out of three) lectures of this particular professor, and I am very responsive during the lectures (I ask questions and I have answers, most of which are correct). As such, I don't think I can be categorized as a ""problem student"" at all. My question is, what was that sheet all about? Is it just a part of a standard bunch of sheets, one for each student (to mark attendance maybe?) that professors carry to class? Should I be speaking to my professor about this?",1

0.033,0.902,0.065,0.705,"So in my infinite hubris I decided to take Math 223 first term, and Math 220 and 200 second term.  This was because I already had credit for first year math courses and I wanted to get them out of the way. What I didn't anticipate was how hard some had made out Math 223 to be, which I'm now scared of because I'd like to specialize in CS, which requires a competitive GPA in first-year. I would say my math background is fairly solid; I wrote math contests throughout highschool and placed well regionally.  Nothing national-tier though. What I'm asking is how hard is the workload going to be and am I going to have to no-life study to make the cut for CS?

Edit: What I ended up doing was dropping MATH 200 and 220 and taking MATH 226 first term instead.  I also dropped PHYS 106 for PHYS 131 second term because it took up the same time slot as MATH 226. This heavily front loads my courses but honestly I think I'd prefer taking MATH 226 over PHYS 106.",1
