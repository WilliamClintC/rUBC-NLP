# rUBC-NLP

This project scapes r/UBC for it's most controversial posts for 2022 and 2021. Using NLP, we chart the most common words and emojis used. 
We then study the sentiment of the posts using sentiment analysis and find that post sentiment overall is positive in the most controversial posts. 
We suspect this is the case due to sarcastic and self promotional posts. In general, the most controversial posts come from first years and people who mention the free speech club.

This is for 2022
